1
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:24,899
Sometimes, we wake with anxiety...

2
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:29,079
and edgy energy.

3
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,753
What will happen today?

4
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,480
What is in store for me?

5
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:42,979
So many questions.

6
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:47,479
We want resolution,

7
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,979
solid earth under our feet,

8
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,499
so we take life into our own hands.

9
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,279
We take action, yeah?

10
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:05,339
Our solutions

11
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,239
are temporary.

12
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:10,600
They are quick fix.

13
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:16,259
They create more anxiety,

14
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,739
more suffering.

15
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:28,419
There is no resolution to life's questions.

16
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,759
It is easier to be patient

17
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:42,499
once we finally accept

18
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:46,659
there is no resolution.

19
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:05,339
Shit! I'm running

20
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:19,779
out of nerves! Shit! Chest

21
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:31,656
cavity. Frank.

22
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,436
Have you ever ha- heard of the black mamba?

23
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,739
Frank! Hey, man!

24
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,986
What are you doing?

25
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:39,117
You want to hang out?

26
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,200
I'm just showing off my moves.

27
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,366
What are you doing?

28
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,469
I got to go.

29
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:47,137
We didn't even get into the ice yet. I

30
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,620
got to catch a plane.

31
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,753
Wait a second.

32
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,760
Wait a second. Hey.

33
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,496
Ah, come on. Hey, man.

34
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:57,656
You're not gonna chase me ov- over here.

35
00:04:57,739 --> 00:04:58,569
Come on.

36
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,040
Wait, let's... Oh, yeah.

37
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:05,456
Come on, man. What's happening?

38
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:05,756
Where you going?

39
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,297
You know what's happening?

40
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,980
You know, I, I gotta go.

41
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:09,376
I gotta go, man. Ah!

42
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,125
I told you, I have to go.

43
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:12,797
You gotta go? Yeah.

44
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,256
Well, y- well,

45
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:14,637
the ladies are here, man.

46
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,816
What's the matter? Stay, okay?

47
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,965
I need you to...

48
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:19,936
Don't you like me anymore?

49
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,196
I just have to go. I have to go.

50
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,876
You're my guy.

51
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,692
Look- Hey, you started it.

52
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:25,297
You finish- I can't finish it without you.

53
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,313
You finish it.

54
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,096
That's not part of the deal.

55
00:05:28,179 --> 00:05:29,512
Hey, there they are.

56
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:30,936
Look at this. Look at this.

57
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:31,756
Ladies, come on.

58
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:34,119
He's, he's saying no. Rick! Rick!

59
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,939
Rick! Rick! Rick!

60
00:06:03,011 --> 00:06:10,011
Hi.

61
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:50,791
Oh, morning.

62
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:53,857
How'd you sleep?

63
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:56,852
I slept okay.

64
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:01,197
Have you seen Lori?

65
00:07:02,392 --> 00:07:03,222
Not yet.

66
00:07:03,511 --> 00:07:06,728
Should we see if she wants to get some
breakfast?

67
00:07:06,811 --> 00:07:08,544
Yeah, I'll go ask her. No,

68
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:10,161
I'll do it.

69
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:30,204
Kate and I are going to go get breakfast.

70
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:32,324
You want to come?

71
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:34,201
Oh,

72
00:07:35,011 --> 00:07:36,388
I think I'm going to keep sleeping, if

73
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:37,301
that's okay.

74
00:07:41,531 --> 00:07:43,771
Listen, I'm sorry about Valentin.

75
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,864
Honestly, had no idea you didn't care.

76
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:49,971
Jack, please, I...

77
00:07:54,811 --> 00:07:56,477
I want to be your friend.

78
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:06,349
We can talk about it later when you're not
sleeping.

79
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:08,228
You want us to bring you back something?

80
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:09,141
No, thanks.

81
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:10,921
Okay.

82
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:30,749
I think I should wait till we're home,

83
00:08:30,832 --> 00:08:32,889
you know, before I tell mom. Like,

84
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:35,768
could you wait till she's back on her meds?

85
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:36,811
Tell mom what?

86
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:39,097
That I'm coming with you.

87
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:45,821
What?

88
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:54,749
Lachlan, I don't want to be responsible
for fucking up your life, okay?

89
00:08:54,832 --> 00:08:56,669
Just let me fuck up my own life,

90
00:08:56,752 --> 00:08:57,582
all right?

91
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:20,951
They're back.

92
00:09:27,071 --> 00:09:28,712
Oh, hi.

93
00:09:31,151 --> 00:09:31,981
How was it?

94
00:09:32,931 --> 00:09:33,971
How did it go?

95
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:36,181
Um,

96
00:09:36,972 --> 00:09:38,231
it was, uh...

97
00:09:44,931 --> 00:09:45,128
You know what,

98
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:47,508
can we actually talk about it later? I

99
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:49,708
just, I want to shower and- Huh,

100
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,511
we'll talk about it at breakfast. Okay.

101
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:00,722
Lachlan?

102
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:02,421
What?

103
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:04,401
Tell us.

104
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:09,177
I don't fucking know anything, okay?

105
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:35,162
Belinda.

106
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:37,071
Hey.

107
00:10:42,552 --> 00:10:45,071
Um, this is my son, Zion.

108
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,264
Yeah, yeah, we met mom.

109
00:10:49,911 --> 00:10:51,177
Right, on the boat.

110
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:53,141
Yeah. Right.

111
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:55,001
Um,

112
00:10:55,591 --> 00:10:56,668
do you want to join us?

113
00:10:56,751 --> 00:10:57,581
It's okay.

114
00:10:57,851 --> 00:11:00,532
I just saw you and just wanted to say

115
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:02,621
hello.

116
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:04,942
Hello.

117
00:11:05,451 --> 00:11:06,281
Hello.

118
00:11:07,571 --> 00:11:08,401
Um,

119
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:10,111
bye. Bye.

120
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:18,411
Sugar? Wow, you,

121
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,751
you like this guy. I don't know.

122
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:23,311
Well, he likes you.

123
00:11:24,431 --> 00:11:25,008
You know,

124
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:26,788
he wants to go into business together.

125
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:27,871
Really? Mm-hmm.

126
00:11:28,392 --> 00:11:30,848
The spa you always talked about? Hmm.

127
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:32,828
Where would we even do it, Ray?

128
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:34,111
Wherever you want.

129
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,212
Hawaii? Here?

130
00:11:36,591 --> 00:11:38,708
He ain't got no money and neither do I.

131
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:39,988
I don't even know where I would get it.

132
00:11:40,071 --> 00:11:41,668
I don't know investors like that.

133
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:42,581
Hello?

134
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:44,264
Do I have to say it?

135
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,652
Z? What? I already told you.

136
00:11:48,392 --> 00:11:49,469
I'm not taking that blood money,

137
00:11:49,552 --> 00:11:50,971
okay? Mom.

138
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,348
Listen, $100,000 isn't enough anyway.

139
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:55,309
We would need more than that,

140
00:11:55,392 --> 00:11:56,222
so drop it.

141
00:11:56,392 --> 00:11:57,488
What if it were a million dollars?

142
00:11:57,571 --> 00:11:58,668
But it's not. Okay.

143
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,617
No, you told him you would get back to him.

144
00:12:01,951 --> 00:12:03,309
Why don't you just see how much you can
get?

145
00:12:03,392 --> 00:12:05,048
Z- You don't have to go through with it,

146
00:12:05,131 --> 00:12:06,031
just see.

147
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,286
See how much you can get.

148
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:11,897
I mean, you're always gonna wonder. If

149
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,936
I go up there and negotiate with him,

150
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:15,276
then I don't do it,

151
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,317
it'll piss him off and then he'll fuck me
up.

152
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,777
No, no. He won't do anything to you.

153
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,856
He's done it before.

154
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:22,339
'Cause I'll be there.

155
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:25,077
And then, plus,

156
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,026
you'll need a professional to help you
negotiate this deal anyways, so...

157
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:51,980
So, you liked it at the center?

158
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,625
Yeah, it's a really cool place.

159
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:56,469
Great.

160
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:59,080
Yeah. It's not a cult.

161
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:03,237
Well, I think it's great that,

162
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,150
that you've

163
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,716
proved to yourself that you can

164
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:08,399
live a simple life like that. It'll all

165
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:11,059
be fine without less, right?

166
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:19,529
Yeah.

167
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,129
Yeah.

168
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:25,409
What?

169
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:33,245
Like, the f- the food.

170
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,116
I mean, it was, it was vegetarian,

171
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:38,029
but it...

172
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,596
I don't know, you could tell it,

173
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,079
like, wasn't organic.

174
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:42,809
And

175
00:13:43,979 --> 00:13:45,979
it was just kinda bland and...

176
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:47,616
I don't know, it was kinda like,

177
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:48,076
"Could I, like,

178
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,759
really eat this for a whole year?"

179
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:55,456
And then... Oh, God.

180
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:57,936
And then I went back to my room and it was
this, like,

181
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,436
tiny little box with, like,

182
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,452
a mattress with stains on it and no air
conditioning and...

183
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,619
I, I, I know, I know,

184
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,796
I know I'm not supposed to be attached to
this kind of stuff and I don't wanna think

185
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:11,759
that I am, but like...

186
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:15,399
I don't know. I think I am.

187
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:16,949
Oh.

188
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:19,359
I know I am.

189
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:24,179
Like, the idea that I'm, like ,

190
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:24,796
that I'm, like,

191
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:27,436
this princess who needs things to be a
certain way, it's

192
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,759
just so pathetic.

193
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,439
It's not pathetic.

194
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:33,916
No, mom, it is,

195
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,599
it is pathetic and, like

196
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:36,976
, I don't know, like,

197
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:38,536
I guess I am spoiled 'cause,

198
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:40,296
like, 'cause like,

199
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,912
I can't live like that.

200
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:44,059
Oh, sweetie.

201
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:47,259
You don't have to prove anything.

202
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:53,136
There's so much suffering in the world and
we have it so easy, and,

203
00:14:53,219 --> 00:14:56,036
like, other people have it so hard and I
just...

204
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:58,185
I feel like it's really unfair.

205
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:03,059
And I just feel really bad.

206
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,559
We're lucky. It's true.

207
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:16,799
Huh. No one in the history of the world
has lived better than we have.

208
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:19,859
Even the old kings and queens.

209
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:25,399
The least we can do is enjoy it.

210
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:29,465
If we don't, it's offensive.

211
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:35,636
It's an offense to all the billions of
people

212
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:36,919
who can only dream

213
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,425
that one day they could live like we do.

214
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,812
Yeah. Oh, baby. Come here.

215
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,936
I'm really sorry I brought you guys here.

216
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:47,849
Oh,

217
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:52,952
baby. Oh. I love you so much.

218
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:13,769
Hey. Hey.

219
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:25,176
If you, uh,

220
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:26,096
if you made one of your shakes,

221
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:26,716
I'd drink it.

222
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:28,799
No, I already had one earlier.

223
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:32,652
Stuff's on the counter if you wanna make
one, though.

224
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:40,439
No one's gonna make you a man.

225
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:42,725
Okay? You gotta do it yourself.

226
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,919
All right, I'll see you later.

227
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:50,896
Well, where are you going?

228
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:51,809
Just

229
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:53,559
down to the beach.

230
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:55,392
You want me to come?

231
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,185
I'm just gonna go read for a little bit.

232
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,279
All right, see you.

233
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,839
Are you mad or something?

234
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:17,879
Okay. Dude, it...

235
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:19,996
Look, like, it,

236
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,896
it's okay for you to, like,

237
00:17:20,979 --> 00:17:22,979
worship me, but don't, like...

238
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:25,319
Worship me.

239
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:28,419
You know what I mean?

240
00:17:30,499 --> 00:17:32,259
Look,

241
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:36,165
all you care about is getting off and

242
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:39,136
I saw you lying there and I thought

243
00:17:39,219 --> 00:17:40,136
you looked a little left out.

244
00:17:40,219 --> 00:17:41,919
And I'm, you know,

245
00:17:42,639 --> 00:17:43,469
a pleaser.

246
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,416
I just wanna give everyone what they want,

247
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,496
and I'm in a family full of narcissists.

248
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:51,512
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.

249
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:54,016
Let's just drop this, like,

250
00:17:54,099 --> 00:17:55,165
forever. Please.

251
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:58,629
Okay?

252
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,139
Sí, yo también.

253
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,126
Hwaddee krupp, P' Lek. Ai'tok nekrab.

254
00:19:05,209 --> 00:19:06,346
Ngo rwo wa ni wan hwut, pee.

255
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:08,666
Tew pee wang 'ea.

256
00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:10,486
Choy telefon glub khong pom dewy.

257
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:12,469
Pom reung laen raut ce kub.

258
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:19,927
How are you, my friend?

259
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,427
Did you like the fights?

260
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,110
I'll look for you after.

261
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:26,329
I was on a date,

262
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,109
and you were busy with

263
00:19:29,889 --> 00:19:30,719
two men.

264
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:33,735
Are they your friends?

265
00:19:34,569 --> 00:19:36,969
Maybe some guys I know from the gym.

266
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:41,669
What are their names?

267
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,956
Why do you wanna know their names?

268
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,309
I think I've seen them before.

269
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:49,615
I don't know.

270
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:52,209
Some good fights, though, huh?

271
00:19:53,349 --> 00:19:54,549
I'll see you soon.

272
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:13,059
Hey.

273
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,700
Hey.

274
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:17,889
You brought my book.

275
00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:19,499
Yep.

276
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:22,222
Read it. It'll change your life.

277
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,110
I'm almost finished.

278
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,890
You've read the whole thing already?

279
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,990
I went to Duke.

280
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,196
Okay, genius. What'd you think?

281
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,066
Yeah, I mean,

282
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:40,926
I thought that the sex

283
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:43,475
stuff was pretty interesting. Mm-hmm.

284
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:46,866
Should read the other ones I gave you as
well.

285
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:47,882
She's amazing.

286
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:50,355
They're not about sex,

287
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:52,722
but the laws of the universe,

288
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,769
how we're all connected.

289
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:58,726
Hmm. She has this theory that there are
different groups, and

290
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:02,626
we're in these groups with people we know
and people we don't know.

291
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:07,109
And these groups are working together to
fulfill this divine plan.

292
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:11,626
And sometimes you don't even know you're
in the same group as someone else, so

293
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:11,967
you and I,

294
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,450
we could be in the same group and not even
know it.

295
00:21:35,969 --> 00:21:38,309
Hey. Hi. Oh. Ah.

296
00:21:49,949 --> 00:21:50,882
How did it go?

297
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:53,646
Well, I didn't kill anyone.

298
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,329
Well, that's good. Yeah.

299
00:21:56,509 --> 00:21:58,575
Yeah. I said what I had to say.

300
00:21:58,749 --> 00:22:01,169
Mm-hmm. Got the monkey off my back.

301
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:04,269
I missed you.

302
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:05,979
Yeah.

303
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:07,479
Yeah.

304
00:22:09,709 --> 00:22:10,539
Yeah.

305
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:34,579
Hey.

306
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:38,907
Sorry I couldn't help you out last night.

307
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,169
It's fine.

308
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:42,629
We'll find someone else.

309
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:44,062
Won't be hard.

310
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:55,709
Well, if it makes you happy, get on.

311
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,627
You know what you should get?

312
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,930
Highlights. Just right here.

313
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:23,129
Hey, Dad. Oh, hi.

314
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,250
Hey, Walky.

315
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,040
Yeah?

316
00:23:47,949 --> 00:23:49,309
Think you could live

317
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,169
with no money?

318
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:59,370
I mean, no money. No house, nothing.

319
00:24:04,749 --> 00:24:06,629
Yeah. Yeah, I think I could.

320
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,329
Think you could?

321
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:20,590
Hey, uh, it's your last day.

322
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,326
Don't just sit in here.

323
00:24:24,154 --> 00:24:26,031
Go, go do something. All right?

324
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:27,193
Go swim or...

325
00:24:29,213 --> 00:24:30,043
Go

326
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:32,753
on. All right.

327
00:24:38,053 --> 00:24:39,314
Later, Dad. Yeah.

328
00:25:48,653 --> 00:25:50,014
I know you know.

329
00:25:52,234 --> 00:25:53,967
Please don't say anything.

330
00:25:54,313 --> 00:25:55,646
If you do, I'm dead.

331
00:25:56,933 --> 00:25:57,611
They will deport me,

332
00:25:57,694 --> 00:25:59,960
I go back to my country. I'm dead.

333
00:26:00,173 --> 00:26:02,239
My friends, all of us are dead.

334
00:26:04,153 --> 00:26:05,190
They can't work.

335
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:07,673
They have no way to make money here.

336
00:26:08,773 --> 00:26:09,471
If you say something,

337
00:26:09,554 --> 00:26:10,754
you're killing me.

338
00:26:11,093 --> 00:26:12,826
You're killing me. Melody?

339
00:26:13,893 --> 00:26:15,950
Um, I'm not sure if you've heard,

340
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:16,870
but the Hollingers are

341
00:26:16,953 --> 00:26:18,750
coming back tomorrow morning.

342
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:20,310
They are hoping to say hello to Ms.

343
00:26:20,393 --> 00:26:23,410
Lemon and take a photo with her before she
leaves.

344
00:26:23,493 --> 00:26:24,759
I'll let them know.

345
00:26:25,013 --> 00:26:27,830
Can you find out if she's okay with a
photo?

346
00:26:27,913 --> 00:26:30,579
We might post it on the hotel's website.

347
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:33,547
It's very important to Kunzita Laa.

348
00:26:33,933 --> 00:26:34,763
Mm-hmm.

349
00:26:51,214 --> 00:26:54,354
Uh, sawasdee kah.

350
00:26:55,953 --> 00:26:57,353
Good morning. Um,

351
00:26:58,194 --> 00:26:59,971
I was just gonna put these on the table.

352
00:27:00,054 --> 00:27:01,211
They're your phones and things. In

353
00:27:01,294 --> 00:27:02,310
fact, uh, he's back- No.

354
00:27:02,393 --> 00:27:02,670
Don't, don't do that.

355
00:27:02,753 --> 00:27:04,570
So, I'll just- Please. No? Yeah.

356
00:27:04,653 --> 00:27:06,490
W- we don't w- want 'em.

357
00:27:06,573 --> 00:27:08,839
We don't, we don't need 'em. Okay.

358
00:27:10,233 --> 00:27:13,433
Are you enjoying having a break from your
phone?

359
00:27:15,453 --> 00:27:17,590
Yeah. Do you know what I could do? I

360
00:27:17,673 --> 00:27:21,870
could put these on the hotel boat that
takes you to the airport tomorrow,

361
00:27:21,953 --> 00:27:25,486
and that way you can detox till the very
last minute.

362
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:29,654
Yeah. Sure. Let's do that. Okay.

363
00:27:30,473 --> 00:27:32,370
Yeah. Pam, uh, when we got here,

364
00:27:32,453 --> 00:27:34,430
you said something about this fruit.

365
00:27:34,513 --> 00:27:35,550
Remind me what you said about it?

366
00:27:35,633 --> 00:27:36,010
Oh, yes.

367
00:27:36,093 --> 00:27:38,626
Uh, the seeds of the fruit are poison.

368
00:27:38,753 --> 00:27:40,290
Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah.

369
00:27:40,373 --> 00:27:43,770
The locals actually call it the suicide
tree, because

370
00:27:43,853 --> 00:27:48,010
people grind up the seeds and eat them
when they want to kill themselves.

371
00:27:48,093 --> 00:27:50,019
So, don't eat it.

372
00:27:50,853 --> 00:27:51,930
I don't think you'd want to anyway. It

373
00:27:52,013 --> 00:27:53,613
doesn't taste very nice.

374
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:02,353
Have a wonderful last day. Thanks.

375
00:28:03,313 --> 00:28:04,313
Sawasdee kah.

376
00:28:54,914 --> 00:28:57,111
Can I get you any drinks?

377
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:59,394
No, we're okay. Uh, two whiskeys.

378
00:28:59,694 --> 00:29:01,590
Rocks, please. Certainly, sir.

379
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:02,739
Yeah, thank you.

380
00:29:05,574 --> 00:29:06,404
Trust me.

381
00:29:07,074 --> 00:29:08,407
We're gonna need it.

382
00:29:17,953 --> 00:29:18,783
Mom,

383
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:21,733
you know how you always say

384
00:29:22,514 --> 00:29:24,030
you always gotta be prepared because you

385
00:29:24,113 --> 00:29:27,113
never know when you're gonna get your
moment?

386
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:29,859
This could be it, mom.

387
00:29:30,973 --> 00:29:32,506
Don't miss your moment.

388
00:29:32,613 --> 00:29:34,833
He killed the bitch. I know.

389
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:38,931
Look, maybe this is the one good thing
that's meant to come out of all of it.

390
00:29:39,014 --> 00:29:40,547
I mean, think about it.

391
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,866
This place is killer, man. You're, uh,

392
00:29:59,993 --> 00:30:01,059
you are balling.

393
00:30:02,973 --> 00:30:03,803
Thank you.

394
00:30:05,993 --> 00:30:08,393
I thought we'd be talking privately.

395
00:30:09,313 --> 00:30:10,413
Sorry. Zion.

396
00:30:12,473 --> 00:30:13,303
Yeah.

397
00:30:13,953 --> 00:30:15,353
Uh, I'm her only son.

398
00:30:15,854 --> 00:30:16,290
We're a team.

399
00:30:16,373 --> 00:30:17,491
It's just how it's always been.

400
00:30:17,574 --> 00:30:18,574
But don't trip.

401
00:30:19,273 --> 00:30:21,006
You know, cone of silence.

402
00:30:21,914 --> 00:30:23,410
Uh, business major, U of H.

403
00:30:23,493 --> 00:30:24,570
I don't care about what you did,

404
00:30:24,653 --> 00:30:25,850
what you're gonna do.

405
00:30:25,933 --> 00:30:28,331
All I care about is business and the
bottom line.

406
00:30:28,414 --> 00:30:29,211
MBA, baby.

407
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:35,803
Hey.My mom brought me up to speed,

408
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:37,697
uh, on your initial offer.

409
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,904
Unfortunately, it's gonna be a pass.

410
00:30:41,643 --> 00:30:42,843
Oh, is that right?

411
00:30:43,803 --> 00:30:46,040
She's just caught up in the ethics of it
all.

412
00:30:46,123 --> 00:30:51,580
She just doesn't think the guilt and the
emotional stress would be worth it, so...

413
00:30:51,663 --> 00:30:56,260
And she wants to focus on starting her own
business 'cause that's her dream.

414
00:30:56,343 --> 00:30:58,020
That was the point of the money.

415
00:30:58,103 --> 00:30:59,163
Yeah, but

416
00:30:59,903 --> 00:31:02,000
that amount of money isn't gonna get it
done, you

417
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:03,560
know? I mean,

418
00:31:03,643 --> 00:31:06,481
for her to take on this kind of risk with
you,

419
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:06,680
you know,

420
00:31:06,763 --> 00:31:08,600
she would need to feel like her dream is
coming true, like

421
00:31:08,683 --> 00:31:09,513
full on.

422
00:31:10,084 --> 00:31:12,217
I mean, you got your dream here.

423
00:31:12,343 --> 00:31:14,209
She's gotta get hers, right?

424
00:31:14,843 --> 00:31:15,180
I mean,

425
00:31:15,263 --> 00:31:16,780
what happens to a dream deferred?

426
00:31:16,863 --> 00:31:17,000
You know,

427
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,520
does it dry up like a raisin in the sun?

428
00:31:19,603 --> 00:31:21,936
Hers has been deferred a long time.

429
00:31:22,623 --> 00:31:23,556
Might explode.

430
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:30,629
Uh, point is,

431
00:31:31,543 --> 00:31:35,520
is there enough money here for everyone to
get their happy ending?

432
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:36,433
I think so.

433
00:31:38,484 --> 00:31:42,417
So, how much would it take for her to get
her happy ending?

434
00:31:43,243 --> 00:31:44,200
Well, we crunched the numbers,

435
00:31:44,283 --> 00:31:46,480
Greg, and if we're being realistic,

436
00:31:46,563 --> 00:31:47,963
all in, soup to nuts,

437
00:31:50,323 --> 00:31:51,423
five million

438
00:31:59,783 --> 00:32:00,613
.

439
00:32:02,343 --> 00:32:03,400
That's not happening.

440
00:32:03,483 --> 00:32:05,523
Look, I know that's a big ask,

441
00:32:06,444 --> 00:32:07,760
but I did do a little research,

442
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,980
and according to the internet, uh,

443
00:32:10,063 --> 00:32:12,203
your wife, late wife, ex-wife,

444
00:32:13,203 --> 00:32:15,381
uh, former wife, rest in peace,

445
00:32:15,464 --> 00:32:18,264
was worth at least half a billion dollars.

446
00:32:19,703 --> 00:32:21,983
Don't believe everything you read.

447
00:32:22,403 --> 00:32:23,021
Oh, I know.

448
00:32:23,104 --> 00:32:28,237
I- I found some very public records where
that number pretty much checks out.

449
00:32:28,463 --> 00:32:32,929
So, what we're asking for is a mere one
percent of your total haul.

450
00:32:33,063 --> 00:32:33,893
We get that,

451
00:32:34,043 --> 00:32:36,221
and we are ride or die 'til the day we die.

452
00:32:36,304 --> 00:32:37,437
We are Team Gary.

453
00:32:40,223 --> 00:32:40,380
I mean,

454
00:32:40,463 --> 00:32:42,500
peace of mind is worth one percent,

455
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:43,649
don't you think?

456
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:47,063
I mean, and you won't miss it.

457
00:32:47,643 --> 00:32:47,940
I mean, what?

458
00:32:48,023 --> 00:32:51,460
You're gonna- you're gonna spend through
all five hundred mil here?

459
00:32:51,543 --> 00:32:51,880
Come on man,

460
00:32:51,963 --> 00:32:54,763
how many years you got left anyway, right?

461
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:02,243
I'm not doing this.

462
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,081
He's not giving us any money,

463
00:33:04,164 --> 00:33:06,420
and this is a waste of time. Okay?

464
00:33:06,503 --> 00:33:07,369
Now let's go.

465
00:33:09,783 --> 00:33:10,700
Zion! Okay mom,

466
00:33:10,783 --> 00:33:11,681
why don't you just give us

467
00:33:11,764 --> 00:33:13,830
businessmen a minute alone? No.

468
00:33:14,383 --> 00:33:15,213
I mean it.

469
00:33:16,603 --> 00:33:23,603
Hey, hey,

470
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:33,940
hey. What are you doing?

471
00:33:34,023 --> 00:33:36,000
I was just making my big pitch.

472
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:41,216
You go back in there and you tell him your
mother takes things very personal.

473
00:33:41,344 --> 00:33:43,160
She doesn't trust him, okay?

474
00:33:43,243 --> 00:33:46,140
And if we don't make a deal and we don't
get the money,

475
00:33:46,223 --> 00:33:47,460
who knows what I'll do?

476
00:33:47,543 --> 00:33:48,880
Look at you playing hard ball.

477
00:33:48,963 --> 00:33:49,920
Yes, mom. Shh.

478
00:33:50,003 --> 00:33:53,869
Just tell him that your mother's a very
honest lady, okay?

479
00:33:54,704 --> 00:33:56,504
But he better come through.

480
00:33:57,823 --> 00:33:59,160
He wants us to be scared,

481
00:33:59,243 --> 00:34:01,576
but we gotta make him scared, okay?

482
00:34:05,963 --> 00:34:07,029
Now go close it.

483
00:34:08,764 --> 00:34:09,594
Yeah.

484
00:35:47,204 --> 00:35:53,984
ว่าไง นี่รีบตอกบัตรแล้วรีบออกมาหาไรเนี่ย

485

ท่านจะทำยังไง

490
00:36:21,243 --> 00:36:23,109
พี่ไม่อยากทำร้ายใครอะ นี่...

491
00:36:27,023 --> 00:36:32,040
พี่ตั้งใจทำงานที่นี่มาตั้งหลายปี อยู่ดี ๆ

ไว้เจอกัน

502
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,440
Boys,

503
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:51,919
it's time to go to dinner. Let's go.

504
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:40,800
Hey, uh, miss. Excuse me. Uh,

505
00:38:41,539 --> 00:38:45,136
w- it's your last night and I thought that
it might be, uh,

506
00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:48,085
fun if we made cocktails in the room later.

507
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,559
Pina coladas.

508
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:53,396
Uh, could you bring some rum and mixtures to
the villa? Get

509
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:54,545
them sent there?

510
00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:56,339
We have a blender.

511
00:38:56,499 --> 00:38:58,565
Yes, I'll let them know. Great.

512
00:38:59,779 --> 00:39:02,719
Pina coladas? Yeah.

513
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,620
It's your last night, so...

514
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,856
I've never had a pina colada.

515
00:39:08,939 --> 00:39:09,872
Are they good?

516
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:11,816
You're not gonna have one tonight either.

517
00:39:11,899 --> 00:39:12,832
You're not 21.

518
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:14,749
Sucks.

519
00:39:32,059 --> 00:39:36,017
Hi. Oh. Hi. You made it.

520
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,319
Yeah. So pretty. Aw.

521
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:41,996
I thought you were gonna miss our last
dinner.

522
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,760
I just had a late night.

523
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,833
How was it? Was it fun? What'd you do?

524
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,149
Uh,

525
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:51,256
I went to the fight thing,

526
00:39:51,339 --> 00:39:52,605
which was whatever.

527
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,599
And then I went back with Alexi to his
apartment.

528
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,279
Uh, okay. Alexi.

529
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,699
Ladies.

530
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:10,959
How was your last day? So nice.

531
00:40:11,219 --> 00:40:12,619
Yeah. Relaxing. Yeah.

532
00:40:13,419 --> 00:40:16,896
I wanted to remind you about your morning
massages and tell you, um,

533
00:40:16,979 --> 00:40:18,556
the owners are arriving tomorrow,

534
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:20,437
Miss Satila and her husband,

535
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,956
and they were hoping to take a photo with
you.

536
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:23,636
Would that be all right?

537
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:24,785
Yeah, of course.

538
00:40:32,819 --> 00:40:36,900
Yes, ladies, um, enjoy your dinner.

539
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:45,799
Too nervous to eat.

540
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:49,956
He was supposed to close it.

541
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:52,439
He said he was gonna think about it.

542
00:40:53,139 --> 00:40:56,516
But I gave him your account number and the
routing number and,

543
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:58,116
like, he could wire the money tonight.

544
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:03,459
There's a line between positive thinking
and delusional.

545
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,076
You're crossing the line, babe.

546
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:07,817
Go big or go home, right?

547
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,840
In a goddamn body bag.

548
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,739
Okay, that's enough.

549
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:17,676
Hey, what are you doing?

550
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:19,416
What do you think I'm doing?

551
00:41:19,499 --> 00:41:20,636
I'm checking my account is what I'm

552
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:22,916
doing over here getting my hopes up.

553
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:29,999
All right. You're

554
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:34,969
free.

555
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:38,099
It's a new day.

556
00:41:39,879 --> 00:41:42,217
Told you you had nothing to worry about.

557
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,099
Of course I was worried. I love you.

558
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:53,692
But, you know, I was never too worried

559
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,679
because amor fati.

560
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:57,796
Do you know what that means?

561
00:41:57,879 --> 00:42:00,560
I don't know what that means.

562
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:03,336
It means you have to embrace your fate,

563
00:42:03,419 --> 00:42:05,952
good or bad. Whatever will be will be.

564
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,130
You know?

565
00:42:08,479 --> 00:42:09,416
And at this point we're linked,

566
00:42:09,499 --> 00:42:10,676
so if a bad thing happens to you, it

567
00:42:10,759 --> 00:42:11,692
happens to me.

568
00:42:12,939 --> 00:42:13,769
Mm.

569
00:42:16,059 --> 00:42:17,877
I think we're gonna be together forever,
don't

570
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,790
you?

571
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:23,419
That's the plan.

572
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:32,879
Is it?

573
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,230
Yeah.

574
00:42:53,269 --> 00:42:55,050
I'm so glad we did this.

575
00:42:56,669 --> 00:42:57,499
Me too.

576
00:42:58,249 --> 00:42:59,646
Thank you for organizing

577
00:42:59,729 --> 00:43:01,529
Jack and Peg for the villa.

578
00:43:01,929 --> 00:43:03,806
Are you sure we can't help pay?

579
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:06,189
No, no, it was my total pleasure.

580
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,549
Um, well, our pastor at our church

581
00:43:11,629 --> 00:43:12,729
talks about how

582
00:43:14,289 --> 00:43:15,755
there's a time in life

583
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:18,087
after years of, you know,

584
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:21,170
watering and weeding and nurturing your
soil,

585
00:43:22,129 --> 00:43:24,729
and then one day, you look around

586
00:43:26,589 --> 00:43:28,455
and your garden is in bloom.

587
00:43:29,429 --> 00:43:31,562
And that's how I feel right now.

588
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:33,322
Everything is in bloom.

589
00:43:34,429 --> 00:43:36,362
All our flowers are in bloom.

590
00:43:40,469 --> 00:43:42,907
I've just been in the mood all week. I

591
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:45,649
really have. I mean, I can

592
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:48,902
do yoga and meditate and whatever, but

593
00:43:49,769 --> 00:43:50,599
nothing,

594
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:51,266
you know,

595
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:54,110
for me makes me feel more grounded than,

596
00:43:54,609 --> 00:43:56,366
you know, being with friends,

597
00:43:56,449 --> 00:43:57,315
real friends.

598
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:01,302
It's a lonely world.

599
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:03,322
It can be, you know?

600
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,906
People judge you for your superficial
defects, and

601
00:44:05,989 --> 00:44:09,386
you guys judged me for my profound defects.

602
00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:11,669
No. You know what I mean. Yeah.

603
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:12,679
And, uh,

604
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:14,366
I've just been on cloud nine all week,

605
00:44:14,449 --> 00:44:16,915
and I really needed it, so thank you.

606
00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:29,567
That's funny 'cause if I'm being honest,

607
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:32,069
all week, I've just been so sad.

608
00:44:34,789 --> 00:44:35,619
What?

609
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:40,042
I just f- feel like my expectations were
too high, or...

610
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:42,875
I just feel like

611
00:44:43,529 --> 00:44:44,186
as you get older,

612
00:44:44,269 --> 00:44:45,666
you have to justify your life,

613
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:46,579
you know,

614
00:44:46,909 --> 00:44:48,829
and your choices. And

615
00:44:50,429 --> 00:44:51,226
when I'm with you guys,

616
00:44:51,309 --> 00:44:52,575
it's just so, like,

617
00:44:54,489 --> 00:44:57,067
like, transparent what my choices were,

618
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:58,270
and my mistakes.

619
00:45:01,029 --> 00:45:03,067
I have no belief system, and I...

620
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:03,386
Well, I mean,

621
00:45:03,469 --> 00:45:05,469
I've had a lot of them, but...

622
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:06,626
I mean,

623
00:45:06,709 --> 00:45:08,427
work was my religion for forever,

624
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,946
but I definitely lost my belief there.

625
00:45:11,029 --> 00:45:13,349
And then, and then I tried love,

626
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:15,846
and, and that was just a painful religion.

627
00:45:15,929 --> 00:45:17,526
It just made everything worse.

628
00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:19,446
And then, even for me, just,

629
00:45:19,529 --> 00:45:20,386
like, being a mother,

630
00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:22,269
that didn't save me either.

631
00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:25,362
But I had this epiphany today.

632
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:30,709
I don't need religion or God to give my
life meaning

633
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,730
because time gives it meaning.

634
00:45:38,909 --> 00:45:41,669
We, we started this life together.

635
00:45:42,609 --> 00:45:42,946
I mean, we're,

636
00:45:43,029 --> 00:45:44,186
we're going through it apart,

637
00:45:44,269 --> 00:45:46,402
but we're still together, and I,

638
00:45:47,129 --> 00:45:48,046
I look at you guys,

639
00:45:48,129 --> 00:45:49,729
and it feels meaningful.

640
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:52,106
And, and I can't explain it,

641
00:45:52,189 --> 00:45:55,147
but even when we're just sitting around
the pool talking about whatever and named

642
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:57,830
shit, it still feels very fucking deep.

643
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:05,923
I'm glad you have a beautiful face,

644
00:46:09,829 --> 00:46:13,629
and I'm glad that you have a beautiful
life.

645
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:18,263
And I'm just happy to be at the table.

646
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:28,819
I love you. I

647
00:46:29,489 --> 00:46:30,319
love you.

648
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:34,909
I love you. I love yous.

649
00:48:29,269 --> 00:48:33,266
I can't even accept, like,

650
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:34,609
one glass? You-

651
00:48:35,569 --> 00:48:37,102
you need to get a Coke.

652
00:48:38,389 --> 00:48:39,219
Come on.

653
00:48:42,329 --> 00:48:43,410
Okay.

654
00:48:44,629 --> 00:48:46,562
Lachy, can- Yeah, I'm coming.

655
00:48:52,101 --> 00:48:52,931
Um,

656
00:48:55,421 --> 00:48:58,154
I couldn't ask for a more perfect family.

657
00:48:59,681 --> 00:49:02,147
We've had a perfect life. Haven't we?

658
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:06,021
No privations, no

659
00:49:07,021 --> 00:49:10,021
suffering. Yeah. No trauma.

660
00:49:13,001 --> 00:49:16,321
A- and my job is to keep all that

661
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:19,107
from you. To, to keep you safe.

662
00:49:23,401 --> 00:49:24,667
Because I love you.

663
00:49:30,762 --> 00:49:31,999
I love you so much.

664
00:49:32,082 --> 00:49:33,618
We love you too. You do.

665
00:49:33,701 --> 00:49:34,839
We love you, dad. We love you, dad.

666
00:49:34,922 --> 00:49:39,221
I'd like to make a toast to Thailand.

667
00:49:40,861 --> 00:49:41,691
And

668
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,858
I just can't wait to get back home.

669
00:49:44,941 --> 00:49:46,861
But to Thailand, thank you.

670
00:49:47,001 --> 00:49:49,401
Khob khun krab. Khob khun ka.

671
00:49:49,701 --> 00:49:51,662
Khob khun, kob, khob kun ka.

672
00:49:52,562 --> 00:49:55,561
Okay. Pina colada? Hmm?

673
00:49:57,841 --> 00:49:59,882
Smells weird. No. No.

674
00:50:02,221 --> 00:50:03,051
No.

675
00:50:04,841 --> 00:50:05,998
It's strong, but it's fine.

676
00:50:06,081 --> 00:50:07,618
It's fine. Drink it. Drink it.

677
00:50:07,701 --> 00:50:09,167
You're good. Drink it.

678
00:50:10,761 --> 00:50:11,591
. Oh.

679
00:50:47,081 --> 00:50:49,641
Oh, god. Dude. Dude.

680
00:50:50,281 --> 00:50:51,778
It's, uh, the, you know,

681
00:50:51,861 --> 00:50:53,598
the- What? Coconut milk is off.

682
00:50:53,681 --> 00:50:55,898
Tim. It's the coco- coconut milk is off.

683
00:50:55,981 --> 00:50:56,811
Put it back.

684
00:50:56,021 --> 00:50:57,058
The coconut milk is off.

685
00:50:57,141 --> 00:50:59,038
Okay, the coconut milk is off.

686
00:50:59,121 --> 00:51:00,959
No, no, no. No, no. Don't drink it.

687
00:51:01,042 --> 00:51:01,882
All good.

688
00:51:13,742 --> 00:51:14,572
Uh.

689
00:51:16,981 --> 00:51:17,811
Okay.

690
00:51:19,102 --> 00:51:20,118
I'll, I'll see you.

691
00:51:20,201 --> 00:51:22,067
I'll see you in the morning.

692
00:51:22,481 --> 00:51:23,801
Is that it, Tim?

693
00:51:24,941 --> 00:51:26,718
Have you ever heard of wine?

694
00:51:26,801 --> 00:51:31,601
What? There are several bottles of wine in
the cabinet right behind you.

695
00:51:33,462 --> 00:51:35,181
Yeah. You know? Yeah.

696
00:51:35,361 --> 00:51:37,918
Lachlan, why don't you get an opener and
get some glasses, uh-

697
00:51:38,001 --> 00:51:39,118
Get some towels. ...

698
00:51:39,201 --> 00:51:40,667
a few glasses of wine?

699
00:51:42,542 --> 00:51:43,299
Ew. Do you want to start- Piper,

700
00:51:43,382 --> 00:51:45,382
can you get the glasses? Yeah.

701
00:54:16,501 --> 00:54:17,634
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

702
00:55:00,493 --> 00:55:07,493
Holy

703
00:55:37,693 --> 00:55:39,873
shit, ma. I called the bank.

704
00:55:40,234 --> 00:55:42,034
It's real. Are you kidding?

705
00:55:42,793 --> 00:55:43,950
And then Greg called.

706
00:55:44,033 --> 00:55:44,491
And w- w- what,

707
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:45,640
what did he say?

708
00:55:45,753 --> 00:55:47,893
He said he gave it to Tanya

709
00:55:48,153 --> 00:55:50,419
as much as he gave it to me. It's-

710
00:55:50,653 --> 00:55:52,291
it's what she would've wanted.

711
00:55:52,374 --> 00:55:54,343
And he said

712
00:55:54,793 --> 00:55:57,930
he wanted to make sure I lived up to my
end of the bargain.

713
00:55:58,013 --> 00:56:00,279
And, and, and wha- what'd you say?

714
00:56:07,134 --> 00:56:10,473
I said that I would. Yes, mom!

715
00:56:10,753 --> 00:56:12,874
Yes! Yes! Wait, wait, wait.

716
00:56:13,693 --> 00:56:14,523
I'm nervous,

717
00:56:15,173 --> 00:56:16,230
but I just gotta wrap up some things

718
00:56:16,313 --> 00:56:18,090
today and then we're gonna be outta here.
Wha-

719
00:56:18,173 --> 00:56:20,239
wha- get outta where? Thailand.

720
00:56:20,594 --> 00:56:21,471
I don't wanna be down the road

721
00:56:21,554 --> 00:56:22,990
from him when he changes his mind.

722
00:56:23,073 --> 00:56:24,691
No, the money's already in the bank,

723
00:56:24,774 --> 00:56:25,813
bro. But still,

724
00:56:26,353 --> 00:56:27,291
I'm gonna be hard to find.

725
00:56:27,374 --> 00:56:28,490
You know what I'm saying? Okay.

726
00:56:28,573 --> 00:56:31,039
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, um,

727
00:56:31,133 --> 00:56:32,370
what about your man?

728
00:56:32,453 --> 00:56:34,750
You two were gonna start a business
together.

729
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:37,166
Don't you wanna start your own spa?

730
00:56:37,653 --> 00:56:40,719
Can't I just be rich for five fucking
minutes?

731
00:56:41,594 --> 00:56:44,993
Yes. Yes, you can. I can? Yes, you can.

732
00:56:45,234 --> 00:56:46,064
Yes, we can.

733
00:56:48,893 --> 00:56:49,723
Yeah.

734
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:53,099
Okay, look. Listen.

735
00:56:53,513 --> 00:56:55,030
Um, why don't you go get ready,

736
00:56:55,113 --> 00:56:56,510
okay? I booked a treatment for you.

737
00:56:56,593 --> 00:56:57,971
It's stress management and you're gonna
need it.

738
00:56:58,054 --> 00:56:58,850
What? No, no, no, no.

739
00:56:58,933 --> 00:57:00,390
I don't need that, ma.

740
00:57:00,473 --> 00:57:01,870
We're too blessed to be stressed.

741
00:57:01,953 --> 00:57:04,230
Look, it's too late to cancel and if I'm
paying, you're

742
00:57:04,313 --> 00:57:06,313
going, so- Okay. Go get ready.

743
00:57:13,573 --> 00:57:14,403
Mom.

744
00:58:32,493 --> 00:58:35,770
She's a Cancer-Venus so it's very intense,

745
00:58:35,853 --> 00:58:37,030
and he's an Aquarius-Moon.

746
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:38,179
It's like, babe,

747
00:58:38,753 --> 00:58:40,090
it's never gonna happen. Right.

748
00:58:40,173 --> 00:58:41,291
He's never gonna give you what you need.

749
00:58:41,374 --> 00:58:43,511
He's gonna withhold forever. Hey.

750
00:58:43,594 --> 00:58:45,750
Can we pick up that story in just a second?

751
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:47,433
I'm still really hungry.

752
00:58:48,013 --> 00:58:48,990
Oh, can you get me a donut?

753
00:58:49,073 --> 00:58:50,414
You got it. Donut.

754
00:58:59,874 --> 00:59:02,893
Well, look who it is.

755
00:59:06,213 --> 00:59:07,746
You come into my house,

756
00:59:08,033 --> 00:59:09,173
lie to my wife.

757
00:59:09,773 --> 00:59:11,373
Get the fuck outta here.

758
00:59:13,393 --> 00:59:14,993
We're on the first boat.

759
00:59:16,253 --> 00:59:18,350
I don't want anything to do with you.

760
00:59:18,433 --> 00:59:20,613
I remember your mother.

761
00:59:25,893 --> 00:59:26,723
Yeah.

762
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:31,673
I knew she was a drunk and a slut,

763
00:59:33,493 --> 00:59:35,559
didn't know she was a liar too.

764
00:59:36,594 --> 00:59:40,394
Wanted you to think your father was some
kinda great man.

765
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:43,533
She told you a fairytale, kid.

766
00:59:45,173 --> 00:59:46,073
Your father

767
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:48,533
was no saint.

768
00:59:50,713 --> 00:59:52,579
You didn't miss out on much,

769
00:59:53,914 --> 00:59:55,847
and that's the fucking truth.

770
01:00:01,393 --> 01:00:02,223
What?

771
01:00:03,013 --> 01:00:05,146
You're gonna try to kill me now?

772
01:00:08,754 --> 01:00:09,887
I don't think so.

773
01:00:34,453 --> 01:00:36,393
What is it? He's here.

774
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:42,053
Who? Just insulted my fucking mother.

775
01:00:45,633 --> 01:00:46,766
Forget about him,

776
01:00:47,814 --> 01:00:48,644
okay?

777
01:00:49,194 --> 01:00:51,153
You're free, remember?

778
01:00:51,974 --> 01:00:53,840
You're over it. How could...

779
01:00:54,633 --> 01:00:57,899
How can I get over everything he's taken
from me?

780
01:00:58,814 --> 01:00:59,880
He took my whole

781
01:01:00,633 --> 01:01:02,134
fucking life.

782
01:01:03,773 --> 01:01:06,973
Just stop worrying about the love he didn'
t get.

783
01:01:08,241 --> 01:01:10,241
Think about the love you have.

784
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:11,831
I love you.

785
01:01:14,401 --> 01:01:15,401
I'm right here.

786
01:01:20,601 --> 01:01:21,378
Are you going to get the

787
01:01:21,461 --> 01:01:23,178
goddamn breakfast up there?

788
01:01:23,261 --> 01:01:24,994
Are you all blind or what?

789
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:29,881
Please don't do something stupid.

790
01:01:33,842 --> 01:01:34,672
Uh,

791
01:01:35,481 --> 01:01:37,814
I'm- I'm fine. I gotta- I gotta go.

792
01:01:38,881 --> 01:01:40,198
You're really freaking me out.

793
01:01:40,281 --> 01:01:42,281
I'm just gonna go see my lady.

794
01:01:42,461 --> 01:01:44,861
What lady? The Indian lady.

795
01:01:45,761 --> 01:01:47,259
That's it. What did I do?

796
01:01:47,342 --> 01:01:49,581
Go on then. I'm going to be okay.

797
01:01:52,022 --> 01:01:52,852
Shit.

798
01:03:14,821 --> 01:03:15,651
Hey.

799
01:03:16,882 --> 01:03:17,712
Yo.

800
01:03:19,081 --> 01:03:20,814
What book are you reading?

801
01:03:20,901 --> 01:03:21,731
What book?

802
01:03:22,501 --> 01:03:23,901
The one in your hand.

803
01:03:24,941 --> 01:03:26,418
Oh. I don't know.

804
01:03:26,501 --> 01:03:28,638
Here, it's like a... Morning.

805
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:30,187
It's a book. Whatever.

806
01:03:30,962 --> 01:03:33,099
I'm going to let your father sleep. He

807
01:03:33,182 --> 01:03:34,012
needs it.

808
01:03:34,801 --> 01:03:35,881
Okay, let's go.

809
01:03:38,301 --> 01:03:40,702
Lachlan, sweetheart, breakfast.

810
01:03:45,162 --> 01:03:46,228
Lachie, come on.

811
01:03:47,261 --> 01:03:49,127
Okay, just meet us up there.

812
01:04:38,522 --> 01:04:40,079
The treatment center, uh, uh,

813
01:04:40,162 --> 01:04:41,338
room is over there by the big blue bed.

814
01:04:41,421 --> 01:04:42,251
Mom,

815
01:04:43,081 --> 01:04:43,911
breathe.

816
01:04:45,102 --> 01:04:47,342
Okay? We did that shit. Yeah.

817
01:04:47,541 --> 01:04:49,607
We did that shit. Yeah, we did.

818
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:52,407
And you worked so hard, mom.

819
01:04:53,481 --> 01:04:55,118
Good things happen to good people.

820
01:04:55,201 --> 01:04:56,067
You're right.

821
01:04:56,921 --> 01:04:57,751
I love you.

822
01:04:58,781 --> 01:04:59,847
I love you, too.

823
01:05:01,621 --> 01:05:02,378
Now go on.

824
01:05:02,461 --> 01:05:04,461
Find your center or some shit.

825
01:05:14,781 --> 01:05:15,611
Zion?

826
01:05:16,481 --> 01:05:17,311
Yes, ma'am.

827
01:05:17,522 --> 01:05:20,188
I will be sitting with you this morning.

828
01:05:20,621 --> 01:05:21,681
Right this way.

829
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:23,558
How are you?

830
01:05:23,641 --> 01:05:24,758
I'm very well, thank you.

831
01:05:24,841 --> 01:05:26,041
How are you doing?

832
01:05:30,482 --> 01:05:31,922
Hey. Hey.

833
01:05:32,982 --> 01:05:33,812
Hi.

834
01:05:34,822 --> 01:05:36,555
I'll be right with you. I-

835
01:05:37,181 --> 01:05:38,358
I- I really...

836
01:05:38,441 --> 01:05:40,307
I- I- I need to talk to you.

837
01:05:40,501 --> 01:05:42,922
I have a session. This is urgent.

838
01:05:43,262 --> 01:05:43,818
Okay, please?

839
01:05:43,901 --> 01:05:45,218
I just need a few minutes of your time.

840
01:05:45,301 --> 01:05:46,701
I can meet you after.

841
01:05:47,781 --> 01:05:48,698
No. No. Uh,

842
01:05:48,781 --> 01:05:50,058
just sit on this bench.

843
01:05:50,141 --> 01:05:51,638
I'll have them bring you a clean blanket.

844
01:05:51,721 --> 01:05:53,454
I need to talk to you now.

845
01:05:54,621 --> 01:05:55,451
Please?

846
01:05:55,961 --> 01:05:56,791
Look,

847
01:05:57,762 --> 01:05:59,762
you'll be all right. Okay?

848
01:06:00,621 --> 01:06:01,887
I'll come find you.

849
01:06:03,641 --> 01:06:04,471
I promise.

850
01:06:05,941 --> 01:06:08,281
Just give me one hour. One hour.

851
01:06:08,681 --> 01:06:10,862
Sorry. I'll come find you.

852
01:08:39,531 --> 01:08:46,531
Locke?

853
01:09:35,392 --> 01:09:36,222
Locke!

854
01:09:43,711 --> 01:09:44,541
Sir!

855
01:09:45,251 --> 01:09:46,211
Wake up. Hey.

856
01:09:47,151 --> 01:09:47,981
Wake up!

857
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:49,381
Sir!

858
01:09:49,891 --> 01:09:50,721
Sir!

859
01:09:52,491 --> 01:09:55,024
Come on. Come on. Co- come on. Come on

860
01:09:55,551 --> 01:09:56,381
now.

861
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:58,011
Help!

862
01:10:01,911 --> 01:10:04,871
Help! Help! Somebody help!

863
01:10:18,191 --> 01:10:19,869
How were the massages?

864
01:10:19,952 --> 01:10:21,092
Oh, fantastic.

865
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:24,584
We had to sneak one last in before we
leave.

866
01:10:25,851 --> 01:10:27,848
Thank you for agreeing to a photo.

867
01:10:27,931 --> 01:10:28,761
Oh. Hi.

868
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:39,992
May I introduce you to my husband, Hsu.

869
01:10:41,071 --> 01:10:42,571
We love your show. Aw.

870
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:44,737
Well, we love your hotel. Good.

871
01:11:09,771 --> 01:11:10,832
Oh, Belinda.

872
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:16,091
How are you today?

873
01:11:17,171 --> 01:11:18,871
Good, yeah. Um,

874
01:11:19,671 --> 01:11:22,371
how are you? I'm good, as usual.

875
01:11:23,891 --> 01:11:24,757
Pornchai, um,

876
01:11:27,012 --> 01:11:29,545
I've really loved getting to know you,

877
01:11:31,372 --> 01:11:32,202
but,

878
01:11:34,371 --> 01:11:36,771
some things have changed for me, and

879
01:11:38,531 --> 01:11:41,131
I'm gonna be leaving Thailand tomorrow.

880
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:45,351
Uh, le- leaving

881
01:11:46,512 --> 01:11:47,342
tomorrow?

882
01:11:50,811 --> 01:11:51,811
What about, um,

883
01:11:54,012 --> 01:11:55,931
starting a business?

884
01:11:57,151 --> 01:11:59,712
You, me? Maybe.

885
01:12:00,811 --> 01:12:01,641
But,

886
01:12:03,112 --> 01:12:05,378
circumstances have changed for me,

887
01:12:05,591 --> 01:12:08,657
and I just can't commit to anything right
now.

888
01:12:13,771 --> 01:12:15,131
I'm so sorry.

889
01:12:19,191 --> 01:12:19,388
Uh,

890
01:12:19,471 --> 01:12:23,891
would you mind very much if we took a
picture together? Oh,

891
01:12:23,991 --> 01:12:26,149
of course. Okay. Okay. Okay?

892
01:12:26,232 --> 01:12:28,388
I'll go over here. Okay. Yes.

893
01:12:28,471 --> 01:12:29,604
Come, come, come.

894
01:12:30,771 --> 01:12:32,471
Beautiful.

895
01:12:33,911 --> 01:12:36,591
Wow. That's beautiful.

896
01:12:38,531 --> 01:12:39,888
One more. One more. Yeah, yeah.

897
01:12:39,971 --> 01:12:42,888
Okay. And maybe one of you will sit there.

898
01:12:42,971 --> 01:12:45,571
Oh, yes. Yes. Okay.

899
01:12:47,452 --> 01:12:49,511
Wow. It's beautiful.

900
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,828
Could Jim get the camera? Yeah.

901
01:12:51,911 --> 01:12:53,111
Thank you so much.

902
01:12:55,651 --> 01:12:56,481
Ah!

903
01:12:57,612 --> 01:12:58,968
Surprise! Oh, yeah. That's good.

904
01:12:59,051 --> 01:13:00,784
That's good for Jim. Yeah.

905
01:13:01,271 --> 01:13:02,804
Yeah. The wife we have.

906
01:13:14,071 --> 01:13:14,901
Rick?

907
01:13:17,512 --> 01:13:18,578
Get out of here.

908
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:25,313
Out of here.

909
01:13:35,764 --> 01:13:36,703
Smile.

910
01:13:40,823 --> 01:13:41,653
Oh, my God.

911
01:13:43,203 --> 01:13:44,033
Oh, my God.

912
01:13:44,823 --> 01:13:45,653
Fuck you.

913
01:13:53,864 --> 01:13:54,694
Oh, God!

914
01:13:58,723 --> 01:14:00,163
Jim. Are you okay?

915
01:14:03,624 --> 01:14:05,583
Are you okay? Go, go, go.

916
01:14:09,183 --> 01:14:10,383
Go. Jim. Jim. Why?

917
01:14:10,723 --> 01:14:12,056
He killed my father.

918
01:14:13,624 --> 01:14:14,864
He's your father.

919
01:14:17,563 --> 01:14:19,743
He's your father. He told me.

920
01:14:20,143 --> 01:14:21,303
He's your father.

921
01:14:37,543 --> 01:14:39,453
Go, go, go, go.

922
01:15:31,303 --> 01:15:35,203
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no.

923
01:15:36,663 --> 01:15:38,196
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, no.

924
01:15:38,563 --> 01:15:39,781
You're okay. All right?

925
01:15:39,864 --> 01:15:41,240
You're going to be okay.

926
01:15:41,323 --> 01:15:42,989
You hear me? You hear me?

927
01:15:44,724 --> 01:15:46,457
You can't die on me, okay?

928
01:15:47,243 --> 01:15:48,083
Chelsea.

929
01:15:53,224 --> 01:15:54,054
No.

930
01:15:54,924 --> 01:15:56,723
No. No!

931
01:16:19,224 --> 01:16:20,054
Hey.

932
01:16:21,183 --> 01:16:23,803
Hey! Help me, please.

933
01:16:38,023 --> 01:16:43,863
I'm

934
01:16:45,483 --> 01:16:47,384
sorry. I'm so sorry.

935
01:16:48,263 --> 01:16:50,760
We're going to be together forever, okay?

936
01:16:50,843 --> 01:16:52,109
Just like you said.

937
01:19:49,753 --> 01:19:51,286
I think I just saw God.

938
01:20:05,293 --> 01:20:06,123
Oh, God.

939
01:20:39,513 --> 01:20:45,353
Kids, look what I have.

940
01:20:57,073 --> 01:21:04,073
Hey,

941
01:21:08,913 --> 01:21:12,433
guys. Wait.

942
01:21:16,954 --> 01:21:18,754
Things are about to change.

943
01:21:23,573 --> 01:21:24,906
We'll get through it

944
01:21:26,073 --> 01:21:26,914
as a family.

945
01:21:28,073 --> 01:21:29,006
Because we're-

946
01:21:30,013 --> 01:21:32,079
we're a strong family and- and,

947
01:21:34,033 --> 01:21:34,210
you know,

948
01:21:34,293 --> 01:21:37,226
nothing's more important than family,
right?

949
01:22:36,833 --> 01:22:43,833
Woo!

950
01:25:20,573 --> 01:25:25,814
Nothing from nothing leaves nothing.

951
01:25:27,073 --> 01:25:30,339
You gotta have something if you wanna be
with me.

952
01:25:32,693 --> 01:25:35,474
Nothing from nothing leaves nothing.

953
01:25:36,453 --> 01:25:39,953
You gotta have something if you wanna be
with me.

954
01:25:47,893 --> 01:25:51,393
I'm not trying to be your hero

955
01:25:52,573 --> 01:25:53,906
because that's zero,

956
01:25:54,393 --> 01:25:56,073
it's too cold for me.

957
01:25:58,333 --> 01:26:03,333
I'm not trying to be your highest 'cause
that, minus,

958
01:26:03,753 --> 01:26:06,393
is too low to see. Yeah.

959
01:26:07,233 --> 01:26:08,153
Well, no.

960
01:26:09,593 --> 01:26:10,423
Hey.

961
01:26:14,193 --> 01:26:17,213
Nothing from nothing leaves nothing.

962
01:26:18,313 --> 01:26:21,793
And I'm not stuffing, believe you me.

963
01:26:24,193 --> 01:26:26,693
Don't you remember I told ya?

964
01:26:27,733 --> 01:26:31,253
I'm a soldier in the war on poverty.

965
01:26:31,573 --> 01:26:33,673
Yeah. Yes, I am.
