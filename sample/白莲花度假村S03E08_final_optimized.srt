1
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:22,389
Sometimes,

2
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:24,899
we wake with anxiety...

3
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:29,079
and edgy energy.

4
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,753
What will happen today?

5
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,480
What is in store for me?

6
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:42,979
So many questions.

7
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:47,479
We want resolution,

8
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,979
solid earth under our feet,

9
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,499
so we take life into our own hands.

10
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,279
We take action, yeah?

11
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:05,339
Our solutions

12
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,239
are temporary.

13
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:10,600
They are quick fix.

14
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:16,259
They create more anxiety,

15
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,739
more suffering.

16
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:27,220
There is no resolution to life's

17
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:28,419
questions.

18
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,759
It is easier to be patient

19
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:42,499
once we finally accept

20
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:46,659
there is no resolution.

21
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:05,339
Shit! I'm running

22
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:19,779
out of nerves!

23
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,496
Shit! Chest cavity.

24
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:31,656
Frank.

25
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:32,156
Have you ever ha-

26
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,436
heard of the black mamba?

27
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:33,696
Frank!

28
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:34,739
Hey, man!

29
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,986
What are you doing?

30
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:39,117
You want to hang out?

31
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,200
I'm just showing off my moves.

32
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,366
What are you doing?

33
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,469
I got to go.

34
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:45,297
We didn't

35
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,036
even get into the ice yet.

36
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,652
I got to catch a plane.

37
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,753
Wait a second.

38
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,332
Wait a second.

39
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:53,249
Hey.

40
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,999
Ah, come on.

41
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,496
Hey, man.

42
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:55,756
You're not

43
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,637
gonna chase me ov-

44
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,550
over here.

45
00:04:57,739 --> 00:04:58,569
Come on.

46
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:00,917
Wait, let's...

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,040
Oh, yeah.

48
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:04,676
Come on, man.

49
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,456
What's happening?

50
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:05,756
Where you going?

51
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,669
You know

52
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,297
what's happening?

53
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,980
You know, I, I gotta go.

54
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:08,956
I gotta go, man.

55
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:09,917
Ah! I told you,

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,830
I have to go.

57
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:12,297
You gotta go?

58
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,256
Yeah. Well, y- well,

59
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:14,056
the ladies are here,

60
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:15,672
man. What's the matter?

61
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:16,816
Stay, okay?

62
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,965
I need you to...

63
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:19,936
Don't you like me anymore?

64
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:20,797
I just have to go.

65
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,196
I have to go.

66
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,876
You're my guy.

67
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,616
Look- Hey,

68
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:23,699
you started it.

69
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:24,577
You finish- I can't

70
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,297
finish it without you.

71
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,313
You finish it.

72
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:26,797
That's not

73
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,013
part of the deal.

74
00:05:28,179 --> 00:05:29,512
Hey, there they are.

75
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:30,456
Look at this.

76
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:30,936
Look at this.

77
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:31,756
Ladies, come on.

78
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,917
He's, he's saying no.

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,119
Rick! Rick!

80
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,417
Rick! Rick!

81
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,330
Rick!

82
00:06:03,011 --> 00:06:10,011
Hi.

83
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:50,791
Oh, morning.

84
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:53,857
How'd you sleep?

85
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:56,852
I slept okay.

86
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:01,197
Have you seen Lori?

87
00:07:02,392 --> 00:07:03,222
Not yet.

88
00:07:03,511 --> 00:07:04,829
Should we see if she

89
00:07:04,912 --> 00:07:06,728
wants to get some breakfast?

90
00:07:06,811 --> 00:07:08,188
Yeah, I'll go ask her.

91
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:10,161
No, I'll do it.

92
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:30,204
Kate and I are going to go get breakfast.

93
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:32,324
You want to come?

94
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:34,201
Oh,

95
00:07:35,011 --> 00:07:35,508
I think I'm

96
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:36,288
going to keep sleeping,

97
00:07:36,371 --> 00:07:37,371
if that's okay.

98
00:07:41,531 --> 00:07:42,268
Listen,

99
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:44,017
I'm sorry about Valentin.

100
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:45,888
Honestly,

101
00:07:45,971 --> 00:07:47,029
had no idea you didn't

102
00:07:47,112 --> 00:07:49,971
care. Jack, please, I...

103
00:07:54,811 --> 00:07:56,477
I want to be your friend.

104
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:04,309
We can talk about it later when you're

105
00:08:04,392 --> 00:08:05,258
not sleeping.

106
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:08,228
You want us to bring you back something?

107
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:09,141
No, thanks.

108
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:10,921
Okay.

109
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:30,392
I think I should wait till we're

110
00:08:30,491 --> 00:08:30,928
home, you know,

111
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:31,809
before I tell mom.

112
00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:33,568
Like, could you wait till she's

113
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:34,784
back on her meds?

114
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:36,811
Tell mom what?

115
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:39,097
That I'm coming with you.

116
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:45,821
What?

117
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,008
Lachlan,

118
00:08:51,091 --> 00:08:51,408
I don't

119
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:52,348
want to be responsible

120
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,568
for fucking up your life,

121
00:08:53,651 --> 00:08:56,669
okay? Just let me fuck up my own life,

122
00:08:56,752 --> 00:08:57,582
all right?

123
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:20,951
They're back.

124
00:09:27,071 --> 00:09:28,712
Oh, hi.

125
00:09:31,151 --> 00:09:31,981
How was it?

126
00:09:32,931 --> 00:09:33,971
How did it go?

127
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:36,181
Um,

128
00:09:36,972 --> 00:09:38,231
it was, uh...

129
00:09:44,931 --> 00:09:45,128
You know what,

130
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:47,408
can we actually talk about it later?

131
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:47,868
I just,

132
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:49,309
I want to shower and-

133
00:09:49,392 --> 00:09:51,988
Huh, we'll talk about it at breakfast.

134
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:52,901
Okay.

135
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:00,722
Lachlan?

136
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:02,421
What?

137
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:04,401
Tell us.

138
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:08,548
I don't fucking know anything,

139
00:10:08,631 --> 00:10:09,461
okay?

140
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:35,162
Belinda.

141
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:37,071
Hey.

142
00:10:42,552 --> 00:10:45,071
Um, this is my son, Zion.

143
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,264
Yeah, yeah, we met mom.

144
00:10:49,911 --> 00:10:51,177
Right, on the boat.

145
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:53,141
Yeah. Right.

146
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:55,001
Um,

147
00:10:55,591 --> 00:10:56,668
do you want to join us?

148
00:10:56,751 --> 00:10:57,581
It's okay.

149
00:10:57,851 --> 00:11:00,532
I just saw you and just wanted to say

150
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:02,621
hello.

151
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:04,942
Hello.

152
00:11:05,451 --> 00:11:06,281
Hello.

153
00:11:07,571 --> 00:11:08,401
Um,

154
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:10,111
bye. Bye.

155
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:16,828
Sugar?

156
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:18,411
Wow, you,

157
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,752
you like this guy.

158
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:20,877
I don't know.

159
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:23,311
Well, he likes you.

160
00:11:24,431 --> 00:11:25,008
You know,

161
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:26,788
he wants to go into business together.

162
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:27,348
Really?

163
00:11:27,431 --> 00:11:28,261
Mm-hmm.

164
00:11:28,392 --> 00:11:29,708
The spa you always talked about?

165
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,629
Hmm. Where would we even do it,

166
00:11:31,712 --> 00:11:34,111
Ray? Wherever you want.

167
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:35,621
Hawaii?

168
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,008
Here? He ain't got

169
00:11:37,091 --> 00:11:38,708
no money and neither do I.

170
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:39,129
I don't even

171
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:39,988
know where I would get it.

172
00:11:40,071 --> 00:11:40,288
I don't know

173
00:11:40,371 --> 00:11:41,668
investors like that.

174
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:42,581
Hello?

175
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:44,264
Do I have to say it?

176
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,648
Z? What?

177
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:47,997
I already told you.

178
00:11:48,392 --> 00:11:49,469
I'm not taking that blood money,

179
00:11:49,552 --> 00:11:50,971
okay? Mom.

180
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,548
Listen, $100,000 isn't

181
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:54,348
enough anyway.

182
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:55,309
We would need more than that,

183
00:11:55,392 --> 00:11:56,222
so drop it.

184
00:11:56,392 --> 00:11:57,488
What if it were a million dollars?

185
00:11:57,571 --> 00:11:58,388
But it's not.

186
00:11:58,471 --> 00:11:58,868
Okay. No,

187
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,551
you told him you would get back to him.

188
00:12:01,951 --> 00:12:02,128
Why don't

189
00:12:02,211 --> 00:12:03,309
you just see how much you can get?

190
00:12:03,392 --> 00:12:04,008
Z- You don't

191
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,048
have to go through with it,

192
00:12:05,131 --> 00:12:06,031
just see.

193
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,286
See how much you can get.

194
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:09,956
I mean,

195
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:10,377
you're always

196
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,056
gonna wonder.

197
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:13,936
If I go up there and negotiate with him,

198
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:15,276
then I don't do it,

199
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,416
it'll piss him off and then he'll

200
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:17,317
fuck me up.

201
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,536
No, no.

202
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:18,976
He won't do

203
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:19,777
anything to you.

204
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,856
He's done it before.

205
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:22,339
'Cause I'll be there.

206
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:25,216
And then, plus, you'll

207
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:25,976
need a professional

208
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:28,296
to help you negotiate this deal anyways,

209
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:29,209
so...

210
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:51,980
So, you liked it at the center?

211
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,506
Yeah, it's a really cool place.

212
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:56,469
Great.

213
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:59,080
Yeah. It's not a cult.

214
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:02,436
Well, I think it's

215
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,052
great that, that you've

216
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,276
proved to yourself

217
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:07,436
that you can live a simple life like that.

218
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,349
It'll all

219
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:10,439
be fine without less,

220
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,469
right?

221
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:19,529
Yeah.

222
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,129
Yeah.

223
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:25,409
What?

224
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:33,245
Like, the f- the food.

225
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:36,096
I mean, it was,

226
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:37,116
it was vegetarian,

227
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:38,029
but it...

228
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,096
I don't know,

229
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:39,596
you could tell it,

230
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,079
like, wasn't organic.

231
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:42,809
And

232
00:13:43,979 --> 00:13:45,979
it was just kinda bland and...

233
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:47,156
I don't know,

234
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:47,616
it was kinda like,

235
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:48,076
"Could I, like,

236
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,759
really eat this for a whole year?"

237
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:54,796
And then...

238
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:55,456
Oh, God.

239
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:56,116
And then I went back

240
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:57,396
to my room and it was this,

241
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:59,276
like, tiny little box with,

242
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:00,736
like, a mattress with stains

243
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:03,219
on it and no air conditioning and...

244
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,619
I, I, I know, I know,

245
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,556
I know I'm

246
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,176
not supposed to be

247
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:09,356
attached to this kind of stuff and I don't

248
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:10,905
wanna think that I am,

249
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:12,069
but like...

250
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:13,976
I don't know.

251
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:14,999
I think I am.

252
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:16,949
Oh.

253
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:19,359
I know I am.

254
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:23,336
Like, the idea that I'm,

255
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:24,796
like , that I'm, like,

256
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:25,796
this princess who

257
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:27,276
needs things to be a certain way,

258
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,825
it's just so pathetic.

259
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,439
It's not pathetic.

260
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:33,916
No, mom, it is,

261
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:34,936
it is pathetic and,

262
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:36,976
like , I don't know, like,

263
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:38,536
I guess I am spoiled 'cause,

264
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:40,296
like, 'cause like,

265
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,912
I can't live like that.

266
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:44,059
Oh, sweetie.

267
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:45,256
You don't

268
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:46,872
have to prove anything.

269
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:49,476
There's so

270
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,756
much suffering in the

271
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:52,956
world and we have it so easy,

272
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:53,776
and, like,

273
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,036
other people have it so hard and I just...

274
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:56,576
I feel like

275
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:57,979
it's really unfair.

276
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:03,059
And I just feel really bad.

277
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:07,359
We're lucky.

278
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:08,559
It's true.

279
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:13,536
Huh. No one in the history

280
00:15:13,619 --> 00:15:16,799
of the world has lived better than we have.

281
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:19,859
Even the old kings and queens.

282
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:25,399
The least we can do is enjoy it.

283
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:28,656
If we don't, it's

284
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:29,569
offensive.

285
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:33,656
It's an offense to

286
00:15:33,739 --> 00:15:35,472
all the billions of people

287
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:36,919
who can only dream

288
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,425
that one day they could live like we do.

289
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,876
Yeah. Oh, baby.

290
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:43,789
Come here.

291
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,936
I'm really sorry I brought you guys here.

292
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:47,849
Oh,

293
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:51,849
baby. Oh.

294
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,759
I love you so much.

295
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:13,769
Hey. Hey.

296
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:25,176
If you, uh,

297
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:26,096
if you made one of your shakes,

298
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:26,716
I'd drink it.

299
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:28,799
No, I already had one earlier.

300
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:29,356
Stuff's on

301
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,356
the counter if you wanna make one,

302
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:31,269
though.

303
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:38,816
No one's gonna

304
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:39,899
make you a man.

305
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:42,725
Okay? You gotta do it yourself.

306
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:47,116
All right,

307
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,465
I'll see you later.

308
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:50,896
Well, where are you going?

309
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:51,809
Just

310
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:53,559
down to the beach.

311
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:55,392
You want me to come?

312
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,185
I'm just gonna go read for a little bit.

313
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,279
All right, see you.

314
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,839
Are you mad or something?

315
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:17,879
Okay. Dude, it...

316
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:20,156
Look, like, it, it's

317
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:20,896
okay for you to, like,

318
00:17:20,979 --> 00:17:21,816
worship me, but don't,

319
00:17:21,899 --> 00:17:22,729
like...

320
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:25,319
Worship me.

321
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:28,419
You know what I mean?

322
00:17:30,499 --> 00:17:32,259
Look,

323
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:36,165
all you care about is getting off and

324
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:38,176
I saw you lying there

325
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:40,136
and I thought you looked a little left out.

326
00:17:40,219 --> 00:17:41,919
And I'm, you know,

327
00:17:42,639 --> 00:17:43,469
a pleaser.

328
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,416
I just wanna give everyone what they want,

329
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:48,236
and I'm in a

330
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,496
family full of narcissists.

331
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:50,196
Dude, dude, dude,

332
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,109
dude, dude.

333
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:53,696
Let's just drop this,

334
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:54,476
like, forever.

335
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,389
Please.

336
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:58,629
Okay?

337
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,139
Sí, yo también.

338
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,139
Hwaddee krupp, P' Lek.

339
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,242
Ai'tok nekrab.

340
00:19:05,209 --> 00:19:06,247
Ngo rwo wa ni wan hwut,

00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,666

342
00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:10,486
Choy telefon glub khong pom dewy.

343
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:12,469
Pom reung laen raut ce kub.

344
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:19,927
How are you, my friend?

345
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,427
Did you like the fights?

346
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,110
I'll look for you after.

347
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:26,329
I was on a date,

348
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,109
and you were busy with

349
00:19:29,889 --> 00:19:30,719
two men.

350
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:33,735
Are they your friends?

351
00:19:34,569 --> 00:19:36,969
Maybe some guys I know from the gym.

352
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:41,669
What are their names?

353
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,956
Why do you wanna know their names?

354
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:45,866
I think I've

355
00:19:45,949 --> 00:19:47,082
seen them before.

356
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:49,615
I don't know.

357
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:50,747
Some good fights,

358
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,660
though, huh?

359
00:19:53,349 --> 00:19:54,549
I'll see you soon.

360
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:13,059
Hey.

361
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,700
Hey.

362
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:17,889
You brought my book.

363
00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:19,499
Yep.

364
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:20,586
Read it.

365
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:22,202
It'll change your life.

366
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,110
I'm almost finished.

367
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,086
You've read

368
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:29,769
the whole thing already?

369
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,990
I went to Duke.

370
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,270
Okay, genius.

371
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,623
What'd you think?

372
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,066
Yeah, I mean,

373
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:40,666
I thought that the

374
00:20:40,749 --> 00:20:42,547
sex stuff was pretty interesting.

375
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,460
Mm-hmm.

376
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:45,206
Should read the other

377
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:46,866
ones I gave you as well.

378
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:47,882
She's amazing.

379
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:50,355
They're not about sex,

380
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:52,722
but the laws of the universe,

381
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,769
how we're all connected.

382
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:56,646
Hmm. She has this theory

383
00:20:56,729 --> 00:20:58,626
that there are different groups,

384
00:20:58,709 --> 00:20:58,967
and we're in

385
00:20:59,050 --> 00:20:59,907
these groups with people

386
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,866
we know and people we don't

387
00:21:00,949 --> 00:21:01,779
know.

388
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:03,366
And these groups are

389
00:21:03,449 --> 00:21:04,226
working together to

390
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:06,150
fulfill this divine plan.

391
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:08,806
And sometimes you don't

392
00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:09,266
even know

393
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:09,526
you're in the

394
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:10,566
same group as someone else,

395
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:11,967
so you and I,

396
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:12,467
we could be in the

397
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,683
same group and not even know it.

398
00:21:35,969 --> 00:21:36,666
Hey. Hi.

399
00:21:36,749 --> 00:21:38,309
Oh. Ah.

400
00:21:49,949 --> 00:21:50,882
How did it go?

401
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:53,646
Well, I didn't kill anyone.

402
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,827
Well, that's good.

403
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,740
Yeah.

404
00:21:56,509 --> 00:21:58,575
Yeah. I said what I had to say.

405
00:21:58,749 --> 00:21:59,286
Mm-hmm.

406
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:01,169
Got the monkey off my back.

407
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:04,269
I missed you.

408
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:05,979
Yeah.

409
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:07,479
Yeah.

410
00:22:09,709 --> 00:22:10,539
Yeah.

411
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:34,579
Hey.

412
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:37,426
Sorry I couldn't

413
00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:38,907
help you out last night.

414
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,169
It's fine.

415
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:42,629
We'll find someone else.

416
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:44,062
Won't be hard.

417
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:54,769
Well, if it makes you happy,

418
00:22:54,949 --> 00:22:55,779
get on.

419
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,627
You know what you should get?

420
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,549
Highlights.

421
00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:01,955
Just right here.

422
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:22,119
Hey, Dad.

423
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,160
Oh, hi.

424
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,250
Hey, Walky.

425
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,040
Yeah?

426
00:23:47,949 --> 00:23:49,309
Think you could live

427
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,169
with no money?

428
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:56,702
I mean, no money.

429
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,370
No house, nothing.

430
00:24:04,749 --> 00:24:05,847
Yeah. Yeah,

431
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:06,996
I think I could.

432
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,329
Think you could?

433
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:19,219
Hey, uh,

434
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,976
it's your last day.

435
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,326
Don't just sit in here.

436
00:24:24,154 --> 00:24:25,487
Go, go do something.

437
00:24:25,873 --> 00:24:26,031
All right?

438
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:27,193
Go swim or...

439
00:24:29,213 --> 00:24:30,043
Go

440
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:32,753
on. All right.

441
00:24:38,053 --> 00:24:38,933
Later, Dad.

442
00:24:39,073 --> 00:24:39,903
Yeah.

443
00:25:48,653 --> 00:25:50,014
I know you know.

444
00:25:52,234 --> 00:25:52,390
Please

445
00:25:52,473 --> 00:25:53,739
don't say anything.

446
00:25:54,313 --> 00:25:55,646
If you do, I'm dead.

447
00:25:56,933 --> 00:25:57,611
They will deport me,

448
00:25:57,694 --> 00:25:58,630
I go back to my country.

449
00:25:58,713 --> 00:25:59,543
I'm dead.

450
00:26:00,173 --> 00:26:00,810
My friends,

451
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,159
all of us are dead.

452
00:26:04,153 --> 00:26:05,190
They can't work.

453
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:07,673
They have no way to make money here.

454
00:26:08,773 --> 00:26:09,471
If you say something,

455
00:26:09,554 --> 00:26:10,754
you're killing me.

456
00:26:11,093 --> 00:26:11,490
You're killing me.

457
00:26:11,573 --> 00:26:12,403
Melody?

458
00:26:13,893 --> 00:26:15,410
Um, I'm not sure if you've

459
00:26:15,493 --> 00:26:15,950
heard,

460
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:16,870
but the Hollingers are

461
00:26:16,953 --> 00:26:18,750
coming back tomorrow morning.

462
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:20,310
They are hoping to say hello to Ms.

463
00:26:20,393 --> 00:26:21,430
Lemon and take a photo

464
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,313
with her before she leaves.

465
00:26:23,493 --> 00:26:24,759
I'll let them know.

466
00:26:25,013 --> 00:26:25,950
Can you find out if she's

467
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:27,233
okay with a photo?

468
00:26:27,913 --> 00:26:29,350
We might post it on the hotel's

469
00:26:29,433 --> 00:26:30,263
website.

470
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:33,547
It's very important to Kunzita Laa.

471
00:26:33,933 --> 00:26:34,763
Mm-hmm.

472
00:26:51,214 --> 00:26:54,354
Uh, sawasdee kah.

473
00:26:55,953 --> 00:26:56,833
Good morning.

474
00:26:57,153 --> 00:26:59,971
Um, I was just gonna put these on the table.

475
00:27:00,054 --> 00:27:00,310
They're your

476
00:27:00,393 --> 00:27:01,191
phones and things.

477
00:27:01,274 --> 00:27:02,230
In fact, uh, he's

478
00:27:02,313 --> 00:27:03,143
back- No.

479
00:27:02,393 --> 00:27:02,670
Don't, don't do that.

480
00:27:02,753 --> 00:27:03,831
So, I'll just- Please.

481
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:04,570
No? Yeah.

482
00:27:04,653 --> 00:27:06,490
W- we don't w- want 'em.

483
00:27:06,573 --> 00:27:07,111
We don't, we don't

484
00:27:07,194 --> 00:27:07,490
need 'em.

485
00:27:07,573 --> 00:27:08,403
Okay.

486
00:27:10,233 --> 00:27:11,191
Are you enjoying having

487
00:27:11,274 --> 00:27:12,874
a break from your phone?

488
00:27:15,453 --> 00:27:17,471
Yeah. Do you know what I could do?

489
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:18,350
I could put these on

490
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:19,350
the hotel boat that

491
00:27:19,433 --> 00:27:21,699
takes you to the airport tomorrow,

492
00:27:21,953 --> 00:27:22,770
and that way you can

493
00:27:22,853 --> 00:27:24,986
detox till the very last minute.

494
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,430
Yeah. Sure.

495
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:28,734
Let's do that.

496
00:27:29,073 --> 00:27:29,903
Okay.

497
00:27:30,473 --> 00:27:31,411
Yeah. Pam, uh,

498
00:27:31,494 --> 00:27:32,370
when we got here,

499
00:27:32,453 --> 00:27:34,430
you said something about this fruit.

500
00:27:34,513 --> 00:27:35,550
Remind me what you said about it?

501
00:27:35,633 --> 00:27:36,010
Oh, yes.

502
00:27:36,093 --> 00:27:38,626
Uh, the seeds of the fruit are poison.

503
00:27:38,753 --> 00:27:39,583
Oh, right.

504
00:27:39,753 --> 00:27:40,290
Yeah. Yeah.

505
00:27:40,373 --> 00:27:41,370
The locals actually

506
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:43,133
call it the suicide tree,

507
00:27:43,533 --> 00:27:44,490
because people grind

508
00:27:44,573 --> 00:27:45,630
up the seeds and eat

509
00:27:45,713 --> 00:27:48,010
them when they want to kill themselves.

510
00:27:48,093 --> 00:27:50,019
So, don't eat it.

511
00:27:50,853 --> 00:27:51,310
I don't think you'd

512
00:27:51,393 --> 00:27:51,890
want to anyway.

513
00:27:51,973 --> 00:27:52,130
It doesn't

514
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:53,279
taste very nice.

515
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:01,766
Have a wonderful last day.

516
00:28:01,853 --> 00:28:02,683
Thanks.

517
00:28:03,313 --> 00:28:04,313
Sawasdee kah.

518
00:28:54,914 --> 00:28:57,111
Can I get you any drinks?

519
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:57,551
No, we're okay.

520
00:28:57,634 --> 00:28:58,767
Uh, two whiskeys.

521
00:28:59,694 --> 00:29:00,627
Rocks, please.

522
00:29:00,854 --> 00:29:01,590
Certainly, sir.

523
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:02,739
Yeah, thank you.

524
00:29:05,574 --> 00:29:06,404
Trust me.

525
00:29:07,074 --> 00:29:08,407
We're gonna need it.

526
00:29:17,953 --> 00:29:18,783
Mom,

527
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:21,733
you know how you always say

528
00:29:22,514 --> 00:29:23,190
you always gotta be

529
00:29:23,273 --> 00:29:24,630
prepared because you never know when you'
re

530
00:29:24,713 --> 00:29:26,179
gonna get your moment?

531
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:29,030
This could be it,

532
00:29:29,113 --> 00:29:29,943
mom.

533
00:29:30,973 --> 00:29:32,506
Don't miss your moment.

534
00:29:32,613 --> 00:29:33,946
He killed the bitch.

535
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,103
I know.

536
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:36,690
Look, maybe this is the one good thing that's

537
00:29:36,773 --> 00:29:38,839
meant to come out of all of it.

538
00:29:39,014 --> 00:29:40,547
I mean, think about it.

539
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:58,010
This place is killer,

540
00:29:58,093 --> 00:29:59,159
man. You're, uh,

541
00:29:59,993 --> 00:30:01,059
you are balling.

542
00:30:02,973 --> 00:30:03,803
Thank you.

543
00:30:05,993 --> 00:30:06,491
I thought we'd

544
00:30:06,574 --> 00:30:07,974
be talking privately.

545
00:30:09,313 --> 00:30:09,771
Sorry.

546
00:30:09,854 --> 00:30:10,684
Zion.

547
00:30:12,473 --> 00:30:13,303
Yeah.

548
00:30:13,953 --> 00:30:15,353
Uh, I'm her only son.

549
00:30:15,854 --> 00:30:16,290
We're a team.

550
00:30:16,373 --> 00:30:16,771
It's just how it's

551
00:30:16,854 --> 00:30:17,491
always been.

552
00:30:17,574 --> 00:30:18,574
But don't trip.

553
00:30:19,273 --> 00:30:19,470
You know,

554
00:30:19,553 --> 00:30:20,619
cone of silence.

555
00:30:21,914 --> 00:30:22,690
Uh, business major,

556
00:30:22,773 --> 00:30:23,410
U of H.

557
00:30:23,493 --> 00:30:23,730
I don't care

558
00:30:23,813 --> 00:30:24,570
about what you did,

559
00:30:24,653 --> 00:30:25,850
what you're gonna do.

560
00:30:25,933 --> 00:30:26,530
All I care about is

561
00:30:26,613 --> 00:30:28,331
business and the bottom line.

562
00:30:28,414 --> 00:30:29,211
MBA, baby.

563
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:34,540
Hey.My

564
00:30:34,623 --> 00:30:35,881
mom brought me up to speed,

565
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:37,697
uh, on your initial offer.

566
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:39,020
Unfortunately, it's

567
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:40,169
gonna be a pass.

568
00:30:41,643 --> 00:30:42,843
Oh, is that right?

569
00:30:43,803 --> 00:30:44,400
She's just caught up

570
00:30:44,483 --> 00:30:46,040
in the ethics of it all.

571
00:30:46,123 --> 00:30:46,360
She just

572
00:30:46,443 --> 00:30:46,760
doesn't think

573
00:30:46,843 --> 00:30:47,461
the guilt and the

574
00:30:47,544 --> 00:30:49,481
emotional stress would be worth it,

575
00:30:49,564 --> 00:30:50,394
so...

576
00:30:51,663 --> 00:30:52,500
And she wants to focus

577
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:53,980
on starting her own business 'cause

578
00:30:54,063 --> 00:30:55,196
that's her dream.

579
00:30:56,343 --> 00:30:58,020
That was the point of the money.

580
00:30:58,103 --> 00:30:59,163
Yeah, but

581
00:30:59,903 --> 00:31:00,900
that amount of money isn't

582
00:31:00,983 --> 00:31:01,920
gonna get it done,

583
00:31:02,003 --> 00:31:02,833
you know?

584
00:31:03,304 --> 00:31:03,560
I mean,

585
00:31:03,643 --> 00:31:04,260
for her to take on

586
00:31:04,343 --> 00:31:06,143
this kind of risk with you,

587
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:06,680
you know,

588
00:31:06,763 --> 00:31:07,100
she would need to

589
00:31:07,183 --> 00:31:08,400
feel like her dream is coming true,

590
00:31:08,483 --> 00:31:09,349
like full on.

591
00:31:10,084 --> 00:31:10,220
I mean,

592
00:31:10,303 --> 00:31:11,903
you got your dream here.

593
00:31:12,343 --> 00:31:13,100
She's gotta get hers,

594
00:31:13,183 --> 00:31:14,013
right?

595
00:31:14,843 --> 00:31:15,180
I mean,

596
00:31:15,263 --> 00:31:16,780
what happens to a dream deferred?

597
00:31:16,863 --> 00:31:17,000
You know,

598
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,520
does it dry up like a raisin in the sun?

599
00:31:19,603 --> 00:31:21,936
Hers has been deferred a long time.

600
00:31:22,623 --> 00:31:23,556
Might explode.

601
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:30,629
Uh, point is,

602
00:31:31,543 --> 00:31:32,120
is there enough money

603
00:31:32,203 --> 00:31:35,136
here for everyone to get their happy
ending?

604
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:36,433
I think so.

605
00:31:38,484 --> 00:31:40,641
So, how much would it take

606
00:31:40,724 --> 00:31:42,857
for her to get her happy ending?

607
00:31:43,243 --> 00:31:44,200
Well, we crunched the numbers,

608
00:31:44,283 --> 00:31:44,800
Greg, and if we're

609
00:31:44,883 --> 00:31:46,960
being realistic, all in,

610
00:31:47,043 --> 00:31:47,909
soup to nuts,

611
00:31:50,323 --> 00:31:51,423
five million

612
00:31:59,783 --> 00:32:00,613
.

613
00:32:02,343 --> 00:32:03,400
That's not happening.

614
00:32:03,483 --> 00:32:04,820
Look, I know that's

615
00:32:04,903 --> 00:32:05,733
a big ask,

616
00:32:06,444 --> 00:32:07,760
but I did do a little research,

617
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,800
and according to the internet,

618
00:32:09,883 --> 00:32:11,460
uh, your wife, late wife,

619
00:32:11,543 --> 00:32:12,373
ex-wife,

620
00:32:13,203 --> 00:32:14,269
uh, former wife,

621
00:32:14,823 --> 00:32:15,381
rest in peace,

622
00:32:15,464 --> 00:32:18,264
was worth at least half a billion dollars.

623
00:32:19,703 --> 00:32:21,983
Don't believe everything you read.

624
00:32:22,403 --> 00:32:23,021
Oh, I know.

625
00:32:23,104 --> 00:32:24,400
I- I found some very

626
00:32:24,483 --> 00:32:25,420
public records where

627
00:32:25,503 --> 00:32:27,836
that number pretty much checks out.

628
00:32:28,463 --> 00:32:28,760
So, what we're

629
00:32:28,843 --> 00:32:29,760
asking for is a mere

630
00:32:29,843 --> 00:32:32,303
one percent of your total haul.

631
00:32:33,063 --> 00:32:33,893
We get that,

632
00:32:34,043 --> 00:32:35,280
and we are ride or die 'til

633
00:32:35,363 --> 00:32:36,221
the day we die.

634
00:32:36,304 --> 00:32:37,437
We are Team Gary.

635
00:32:40,223 --> 00:32:40,380
I mean,

636
00:32:40,463 --> 00:32:42,500
peace of mind is worth one percent,

637
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:43,649
don't you think?

638
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:45,620
I mean, and you won't

639
00:32:45,703 --> 00:32:46,533
miss it.

640
00:32:47,643 --> 00:32:47,940
I mean, what?

641
00:32:48,023 --> 00:32:48,721
You're gonna- you're

642
00:32:48,804 --> 00:32:49,300
gonna spend through

643
00:32:49,383 --> 00:32:51,116
all five hundred mil here?

644
00:32:51,543 --> 00:32:51,880
Come on man,

645
00:32:51,963 --> 00:32:53,240
how many years you got left anyway,

646
00:32:53,323 --> 00:32:54,153
right?

647
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:02,243
I'm not doing this.

648
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,081
He's not giving us any money,

649
00:33:04,164 --> 00:33:05,980
and this is a waste of time.

650
00:33:06,063 --> 00:33:07,329
Okay? Now let's go.

651
00:33:09,783 --> 00:33:11,020
Zion! Okay mom, why don't

652
00:33:11,103 --> 00:33:13,060
you just give us businessmen a minute
alone?

653
00:33:13,143 --> 00:33:15,213
No. I mean it.

654
00:33:16,603 --> 00:33:23,603
Hey,

655
00:33:31,503 --> 00:33:31,640
hey, hey.

656
00:33:31,723 --> 00:33:33,940
What are you doing?

657
00:33:34,023 --> 00:33:36,000
I was just making my big pitch.

658
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:37,416
You go back in there

659
00:33:37,624 --> 00:33:38,261
and you tell him your

660
00:33:38,344 --> 00:33:40,610
mother takes things very personal.

661
00:33:41,344 --> 00:33:42,201
She doesn't trust him,

662
00:33:42,284 --> 00:33:43,640
okay? And if we don't

663
00:33:43,723 --> 00:33:44,300
make a deal and we don't

664
00:33:44,383 --> 00:33:45,316
get the money,

665
00:33:46,223 --> 00:33:46,940
who knows what I'll

666
00:33:47,023 --> 00:33:48,880
do? Look at you playing hard ball.

667
00:33:48,963 --> 00:33:49,681
Yes, mom.

668
00:33:49,764 --> 00:33:51,901
Shh. Just tell him that your mother's

669
00:33:51,984 --> 00:33:53,080
a very honest lady,

670
00:33:53,163 --> 00:33:53,993
okay?

671
00:33:54,704 --> 00:33:56,504
But he better come through.

672
00:33:57,823 --> 00:33:59,160
He wants us to be scared,

673
00:33:59,243 --> 00:34:00,720
but we gotta make him scared,

674
00:34:00,803 --> 00:34:01,633
okay?

675
00:34:05,963 --> 00:34:07,029
Now go close it.

676
00:34:08,764 --> 00:34:09,594
Yeah.

677
00:35:47,204 --> 00:35:53,984
ว่าไง นี่รีบตอกบัตรแล้วรีบออกมาหาไรเนี่ย

it's time to go to dinner.

710
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:51,919
Let's go.

711
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:39,639
Hey, uh, miss.

712
00:38:39,899 --> 00:38:40,456
Excuse me.

713
00:38:40,539 --> 00:38:41,936
Uh, w- it's your

714
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,819
last night and I thought that it might be,

715
00:38:44,939 --> 00:38:48,085
uh, fun if we made cocktails in the room later.

716
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,559
Pina coladas.

717
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:51,896
Uh, could you bring some

718
00:38:51,979 --> 00:38:53,256
rum and mixtures to the villa?

719
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:54,672
Get them sent there?

720
00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:56,339
We have a blender.

721
00:38:56,499 --> 00:38:57,776
Yes, I'll let them know.

722
00:38:57,859 --> 00:38:58,689
Great.

723
00:38:59,779 --> 00:39:02,336
Pina coladas?

724
00:39:02,419 --> 00:39:03,249
Yeah.

725
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,816
It's your last night,

726
00:39:04,899 --> 00:39:05,729
so...

727
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,856
I've never had a pina colada.

728
00:39:08,939 --> 00:39:09,872
Are they good?

729
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:10,336
You're not

730
00:39:10,419 --> 00:39:11,816
gonna have one tonight either.

731
00:39:11,899 --> 00:39:12,832
You're not 21.

732
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:14,749
Sucks.

733
00:39:32,059 --> 00:39:32,980
Hi.

734
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:36,017
Oh. Hi. You made it.

735
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,239
Yeah. So pretty.

736
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,430
Aw.

737
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:40,537
I thought you were

738
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,996
gonna miss our last dinner.

739
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,760
I just had a late night.

740
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,116
How was it?

741
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:46,797
Was it fun?

742
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,813
What'd you do?

743
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,149
Uh,

744
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:51,256
I went to the fight thing,

745
00:39:51,339 --> 00:39:52,605
which was whatever.

746
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,297
And then I went back

747
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,599
with Alexi to his apartment.

748
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,279
Uh, okay. Alexi.

749
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,699
Ladies.

750
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:08,776
How was your last day?

751
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:10,959
So nice.

752
00:40:11,219 --> 00:40:12,236
Yeah. Relaxing.

753
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,176
Yeah. I wanted to remind

754
00:40:14,259 --> 00:40:15,217
you about your morning

755
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,536
massages and tell you,

756
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:18,556
um, the owners are arriving tomorrow,

757
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:20,437
Miss Satila and her husband,

758
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,516
and they were hoping

759
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,956
to take a photo with you.

760
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:23,636
Would that be all right?

761
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:24,785
Yeah, of course.

762
00:40:32,819 --> 00:40:35,619
Yes, ladies, um,

763
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:37,399
enjoy your dinner.

764
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:45,799
Too nervous to eat.

765
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:49,956
He was supposed to close it.

766
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:52,439
He said he was gonna think about it.

767
00:40:53,139 --> 00:40:53,776
But I gave him your

768
00:40:53,859 --> 00:40:56,516
account number and the routing number and,

769
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:58,116
like, he could wire the money tonight.

770
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:00,516
There's a

771
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:01,429
line between

772
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,820
positive thinking and delusional.

773
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:04,956
You're crossing the line,

774
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:06,877
babe. Go big or go home,

775
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,790
right?

776
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,840
In a goddamn body bag.

777
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,739
Okay, that's enough.

778
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:17,676
Hey, what are you doing?

779
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:18,496
What do you think I'm

780
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:19,409
doing?

781
00:41:19,499 --> 00:41:20,636
I'm checking my account is what I'm

782
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:22,916
doing over here getting my hopes up.

783
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:28,236
All right.

784
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:34,620
You're free.

785
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:38,099
It's a new day.

786
00:41:39,879 --> 00:41:42,217
Told you you had nothing to worry about.

787
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,000
Of course I was worried.

788
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:45,209
I love you.

789
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:51,336
But, you know,

790
00:41:51,419 --> 00:41:52,952
I was never too worried

791
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,679
because amor fati.

792
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:57,796
Do you know what that means?

793
00:41:57,879 --> 00:41:59,736
I don't know

794
00:41:59,819 --> 00:42:00,885
what that means.

795
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:03,336
It means you have to embrace your fate,

796
00:42:03,419 --> 00:42:04,249
good or bad.

797
00:42:04,499 --> 00:42:06,165
Whatever will be will be.

798
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,130
You know?

799
00:42:08,479 --> 00:42:09,056
And at this point we're

800
00:42:09,139 --> 00:42:09,416
linked,

801
00:42:09,499 --> 00:42:10,597
so if a bad thing happens to you,

802
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,813
it happens to me.

803
00:42:12,939 --> 00:42:13,769
Mm.

804
00:42:16,059 --> 00:42:16,776
I think we're

805
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:17,696
gonna be together forever,

806
00:42:17,779 --> 00:42:18,609
don't you?

807
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:23,419
That's the plan.

808
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:32,879
Is it?

809
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,230
Yeah.

810
00:42:53,269 --> 00:42:55,050
I'm so glad we did this.

811
00:42:56,669 --> 00:42:57,499
Me too.

812
00:42:58,249 --> 00:42:59,646
Thank you for organizing

813
00:42:59,729 --> 00:43:01,529
Jack and Peg for the villa.

814
00:43:01,929 --> 00:43:02,706
Are you sure we can't

815
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:03,619
help pay?

816
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:04,987
No, no,

817
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,736
it was my total pleasure.

818
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,206
Um, well,

819
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:10,889
our pastor at our church

820
00:43:11,629 --> 00:43:12,729
talks about how

821
00:43:14,289 --> 00:43:15,755
there's a time in life

822
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:18,087
after years of, you know,

823
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,567
watering and weeding

824
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:21,250
and nurturing your soil,

825
00:43:22,129 --> 00:43:23,262
and then one day,

826
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:24,850
you look around

827
00:43:26,589 --> 00:43:28,455
and your garden is in bloom.

828
00:43:29,429 --> 00:43:29,666
And that's

829
00:43:29,749 --> 00:43:31,149
how I feel right now.

830
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:33,322
Everything is in bloom.

831
00:43:34,429 --> 00:43:36,362
All our flowers are in bloom.

832
00:43:40,469 --> 00:43:42,766
I've just been in the mood all week.

833
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:43,782
I really have.

834
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:45,649
I mean, I can

835
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:48,407
do yoga and meditate and whatever,

836
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:50,599
but nothing,

837
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:51,266
you know,

838
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:54,110
for me makes me feel more grounded than,

839
00:43:54,609 --> 00:43:54,827
you know,

840
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:56,176
being with friends,

841
00:43:56,449 --> 00:43:57,315
real friends.

842
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:01,302
It's a lonely world.

843
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:03,322
It can be, you know?

844
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:04,206
People judge you

845
00:44:04,289 --> 00:44:05,787
for your superficial defects,

846
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:07,326
and you guys judged

847
00:44:07,409 --> 00:44:09,386
me for my profound defects.

848
00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:11,247
No. You know what I mean.

849
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,409
Yeah. And, uh,

850
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:14,366
I've just been on cloud nine all week,

851
00:44:14,449 --> 00:44:15,346
and I really needed it,

852
00:44:15,429 --> 00:44:16,610
so thank you.

853
00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:28,366
That's funny

854
00:44:28,449 --> 00:44:28,666
'cause if

855
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:29,567
I'm being honest,

856
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:30,086
all week,

857
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:32,069
I've just been so sad.

858
00:44:34,789 --> 00:44:35,619
What?

859
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:37,086
I just f-

860
00:44:37,169 --> 00:44:39,107
feel like my expectations were too high,

861
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:40,020
or...

862
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:42,875
I just feel like

863
00:44:43,529 --> 00:44:44,186
as you get older,

864
00:44:44,269 --> 00:44:45,666
you have to justify your life,

865
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:46,579
you know,

866
00:44:46,909 --> 00:44:48,042
and your choices.

867
00:44:48,529 --> 00:44:49,359
And

868
00:44:50,429 --> 00:44:51,226
when I'm with you guys,

869
00:44:51,309 --> 00:44:52,575
it's just so, like,

870
00:44:54,489 --> 00:44:57,067
like, transparent what my choices were,

871
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:58,270
and my mistakes.

872
00:45:01,029 --> 00:45:02,227
I have no belief system,

873
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:03,067
and I...

874
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:03,587
Well, I mean, I've

875
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:04,306
had a lot of them,

876
00:45:04,389 --> 00:45:05,219
but...

877
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:06,626
I mean,

878
00:45:06,709 --> 00:45:08,427
work was my religion for forever,

879
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,946
but I definitely lost my belief there.

880
00:45:11,029 --> 00:45:11,859
And then,

881
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:13,507
and then I tried love,

882
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:15,846
and, and that was just a painful religion.

883
00:45:15,929 --> 00:45:17,526
It just made everything worse.

884
00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:19,227
And then, even for me,

885
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:19,706
just, like,

886
00:45:19,789 --> 00:45:20,386
being a mother,

887
00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:20,846
that didn't

888
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:21,929
save me either.

889
00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:25,362
But I had this epiphany today.

890
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:27,679
I don't need

891
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:30,709
religion or God to give my life meaning

892
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,730
because time gives it meaning.

893
00:45:38,909 --> 00:45:41,669
We, we started this life together.

894
00:45:42,609 --> 00:45:43,147
I mean, we're, we're

895
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:44,186
going through it apart,

896
00:45:44,269 --> 00:45:45,846
but we're still together,

897
00:45:45,929 --> 00:45:48,046
and I, I look at you guys,

898
00:45:48,129 --> 00:45:49,729
and it feels meaningful.

899
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:52,106
And, and I can't explain it,

900
00:45:52,189 --> 00:45:52,787
but even when we're

901
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:53,406
just sitting around

902
00:45:53,489 --> 00:45:54,326
the pool talking about

903
00:45:54,409 --> 00:45:55,526
whatever and named shit,

904
00:45:55,609 --> 00:45:57,809
it still feels very fucking deep.

905
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:05,923
I'm glad you have a beautiful face,

906
00:46:09,829 --> 00:46:10,647
and I'm glad

907
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:13,629
that you have a beautiful life.

908
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:16,287
And I'm just

909
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:18,036
happy to be at the table.

910
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:28,546
I love you.

911
00:46:28,629 --> 00:46:30,319
I love you.

912
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:32,866
I love you.

913
00:46:32,949 --> 00:46:34,909
I love yous.

914
00:48:29,269 --> 00:48:32,606
I can't

915
00:48:32,689 --> 00:48:33,266
even accept, like,

916
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:34,179
one glass?

917
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:37,102
You- you need to get a Coke.

918
00:48:38,389 --> 00:48:39,219
Come on.

919
00:48:42,329 --> 00:48:43,410
Okay.

920
00:48:44,629 --> 00:48:45,567
Lachy, can- Yeah,

921
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:46,480
I'm coming.

922
00:48:52,101 --> 00:48:52,931
Um,

923
00:48:55,421 --> 00:48:56,199
I couldn't ask

924
00:48:56,282 --> 00:48:58,015
for a more perfect family.

925
00:48:59,681 --> 00:49:01,338
We've had a perfect life.

926
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:02,251
Haven't we?

927
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:06,021
No privations, no

928
00:49:07,021 --> 00:49:07,851
suffering.

929
00:49:08,281 --> 00:49:10,021
Yeah. No trauma.

930
00:49:13,001 --> 00:49:16,321
A- and my job is to keep all that

931
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:17,799
from you.

932
00:49:17,882 --> 00:49:19,282
To, to keep you safe.

933
00:49:23,401 --> 00:49:24,667
Because I love you.

934
00:49:30,762 --> 00:49:31,999
I love you so much.

935
00:49:32,082 --> 00:49:32,878
We love you too.

936
00:49:32,961 --> 00:49:33,618
You do.

937
00:49:33,701 --> 00:49:34,531
We love you, dad.

938
00:49:33,722 --> 00:49:34,839
We love you, dad.

939
00:49:34,922 --> 00:49:39,221
I'd like to make a toast to Thailand.

940
00:49:40,861 --> 00:49:41,691
And

941
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:43,038
I just can't

942
00:49:43,121 --> 00:49:44,587
wait to get back home.

943
00:49:44,941 --> 00:49:46,007
But to Thailand,

944
00:49:46,222 --> 00:49:46,918
thank you.

945
00:49:47,001 --> 00:49:48,021
Khob khun krab.

946
00:49:48,281 --> 00:49:49,401
Khob khun ka.

947
00:49:49,701 --> 00:49:50,738
Khob khun, kob,

948
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:51,662
khob kun ka.

949
00:49:52,562 --> 00:49:54,721
Okay. Pina colada?

950
00:49:55,261 --> 00:49:56,091
Hmm?

951
00:49:57,841 --> 00:49:58,659
Smells weird.

952
00:49:58,742 --> 00:49:59,882
No. No.

953
00:50:02,221 --> 00:50:03,051
No.

954
00:50:04,841 --> 00:50:05,538
It's strong, but it's

955
00:50:05,621 --> 00:50:06,498
fine. It's fine.

956
00:50:06,581 --> 00:50:06,879
Drink it.

957
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:07,618
Drink it.

958
00:50:07,701 --> 00:50:08,531
You're good.

959
00:50:08,681 --> 00:50:09,511
Drink it.

960
00:50:10,761 --> 00:50:11,591
. Oh.

961
00:50:47,081 --> 00:50:47,918
Oh, god.

962
00:50:48,001 --> 00:50:49,641
Dude. Dude.

963
00:50:50,281 --> 00:50:51,778
It's, uh, the, you know,

964
00:50:51,861 --> 00:50:52,098
the- What?

965
00:50:52,181 --> 00:50:53,598
Coconut milk is off.

966
00:50:53,681 --> 00:50:54,918
Tim. It's the coco-

967
00:50:55,001 --> 00:50:55,898
coconut milk is off.

968
00:50:55,981 --> 00:50:56,811
Put it back.

969
00:50:56,021 --> 00:50:57,058
The coconut milk is off.

970
00:50:57,141 --> 00:50:59,038
Okay, the coconut milk is off.

971
00:50:59,121 --> 00:50:59,959
No, no, no.

972
00:51:00,042 --> 00:51:00,959
No, no. Don't drink it.

973
00:51:01,042 --> 00:51:01,882
All good.

974
00:51:13,742 --> 00:51:14,572
Uh.

975
00:51:16,981 --> 00:51:17,811
Okay.

976
00:51:19,102 --> 00:51:20,118
I'll, I'll see you.

977
00:51:20,201 --> 00:51:22,067
I'll see you in the morning.

978
00:51:22,481 --> 00:51:23,801
Is that it, Tim?

979
00:51:24,941 --> 00:51:26,718
Have you ever heard of wine?

980
00:51:26,801 --> 00:51:28,038
What? There are several

981
00:51:28,121 --> 00:51:29,138
bottles of wine in the

982
00:51:29,221 --> 00:51:31,062
cabinet right behind you.

983
00:51:33,462 --> 00:51:34,721
Yeah. You know?

984
00:51:34,861 --> 00:51:35,918
Yeah. Lachlan, why don't

985
00:51:36,001 --> 00:51:37,898
you get an opener and get some glasses,

986
00:51:37,981 --> 00:51:38,478
uh- Get some towels.

987
00:51:38,561 --> 00:51:40,642
... a few glasses of wine?

988
00:51:42,542 --> 00:51:42,898
Ew. Do you want to start-

989
00:51:42,981 --> 00:51:43,299
Piper,

990
00:51:43,382 --> 00:51:44,418
can you get the glasses?

991
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:45,331
Yeah.

992
00:54:16,501 --> 00:54:17,018
Yeah. Okay.

993
00:54:17,101 --> 00:54:17,931
Okay.

994
00:55:00,493 --> 00:55:07,493
Holy

995
00:55:37,693 --> 00:55:38,523
shit, ma.

996
00:55:38,973 --> 00:55:40,151
I called the bank.

997
00:55:40,234 --> 00:55:41,064
It's real.

998
00:55:41,173 --> 00:55:42,239
Are you kidding?

999
00:55:42,793 --> 00:55:43,950
And then Greg called.

1000
00:55:44,033 --> 00:55:44,491
And w- w- what,

1001
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:45,640
what did he say?

1002
00:55:45,753 --> 00:55:47,370
He said he gave it to

1003
00:55:47,453 --> 00:55:49,370
Tanya as much as he gave it to me.

1004
00:55:49,453 --> 00:55:51,131
It's- it's what she would've

1005
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:52,044
wanted.

1006
00:55:52,374 --> 00:55:54,343
And he said

1007
00:55:54,793 --> 00:55:55,530
he wanted to make sure

1008
00:55:55,613 --> 00:55:57,930
I lived up to my end of the bargain.

1009
00:55:58,013 --> 00:55:58,490
And, and, and wha-

1010
00:55:58,573 --> 00:55:59,573
what'd you say?

1011
00:56:07,134 --> 00:56:09,511
I said that I would.

1012
00:56:09,594 --> 00:56:10,473
Yes, mom!

1013
00:56:10,753 --> 00:56:12,170
Yes! Yes!

1014
00:56:12,253 --> 00:56:13,386
Wait, wait, wait.

1015
00:56:13,693 --> 00:56:14,523
I'm nervous,

1016
00:56:15,173 --> 00:56:15,770
but I just gotta wrap

1017
00:56:15,853 --> 00:56:16,791
up some things today and then we're

1018
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:17,890
gonna be outta here.

1019
00:56:17,973 --> 00:56:18,310
Wha- wha-

1020
00:56:18,393 --> 00:56:19,310
get outta where?

1021
00:56:19,393 --> 00:56:20,223
Thailand.

1022
00:56:20,594 --> 00:56:20,871
I don't wanna

1023
00:56:20,954 --> 00:56:21,630
be down the road from

1024
00:56:21,713 --> 00:56:22,990
him when he changes his mind.

1025
00:56:23,073 --> 00:56:23,691
No, the money's

1026
00:56:23,774 --> 00:56:24,691
already in the bank,

1027
00:56:24,774 --> 00:56:25,813
bro. But still,

1028
00:56:26,353 --> 00:56:27,291
I'm gonna be hard to find.

1029
00:56:27,374 --> 00:56:27,691
You know what I'm

1030
00:56:27,774 --> 00:56:28,151
saying?

1031
00:56:28,234 --> 00:56:28,930
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

1032
00:56:29,013 --> 00:56:29,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1033
00:56:29,693 --> 00:56:30,523
Um, um,

1034
00:56:31,133 --> 00:56:32,370
what about your man?

1035
00:56:32,453 --> 00:56:32,990
You two were gonna

1036
00:56:33,073 --> 00:56:34,750
start a business together.

1037
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:37,166
Don't you wanna start your own spa?

1038
00:56:37,653 --> 00:56:38,291
Can't I just be

1039
00:56:38,374 --> 00:56:40,374
rich for five fucking minutes?

1040
00:56:41,594 --> 00:56:43,471
Yes. Yes, you can.

1041
00:56:43,554 --> 00:56:44,993
I can? Yes, you can.

1042
00:56:45,234 --> 00:56:46,064
Yes, we can.

1043
00:56:48,893 --> 00:56:49,723
Yeah.

1044
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:52,610
Okay, look.

1045
00:56:52,693 --> 00:56:53,430
Listen.

1046
00:56:53,513 --> 00:56:55,030
Um, why don't you go get ready,

1047
00:56:55,113 --> 00:56:56,510
okay? I booked a treatment for you.

1048
00:56:56,593 --> 00:56:57,490
It's stress management and you're

1049
00:56:57,573 --> 00:56:57,971
gonna need it.

1050
00:56:58,054 --> 00:56:58,651
What? No, no, no,

1051
00:56:58,734 --> 00:56:59,550
no. I don't need that,

1052
00:56:59,633 --> 00:57:01,870
ma. We're too blessed to be stressed.

1053
00:57:01,953 --> 00:57:03,810
Look, it's too late to cancel and if I'm

1054
00:57:03,893 --> 00:57:04,610
paying, you're going,

1055
00:57:04,693 --> 00:57:05,310
so- Okay.

1056
00:57:05,393 --> 00:57:06,259
Go get ready.

1057
00:57:13,573 --> 00:57:14,403
Mom.

1058
00:58:32,493 --> 00:58:33,970
She's a

1059
00:58:34,053 --> 00:58:35,070
Cancer-Venus so it's

1060
00:58:35,153 --> 00:58:36,090
very intense, and he's

1061
00:58:36,173 --> 00:58:37,030
an Aquarius-Moon.

1062
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:38,179
It's like, babe,

1063
00:58:38,753 --> 00:58:39,610
it's never gonna happen.

1064
00:58:39,693 --> 00:58:40,090
Right.

1065
00:58:40,173 --> 00:58:41,291
He's never gonna give you what you need.

1066
00:58:41,374 --> 00:58:42,810
He's gonna withhold forever.

1067
00:58:42,893 --> 00:58:45,750
Hey. Can we pick up that story in just a second?

1068
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:47,433
I'm still really hungry.

1069
00:58:48,013 --> 00:58:48,990
Oh, can you get me a donut?

1070
00:58:49,073 --> 00:58:49,850
You got it.

1071
00:58:49,933 --> 00:58:50,763
Donut.

1072
00:58:59,874 --> 00:59:02,893
Well, look who it is.

1073
00:59:06,213 --> 00:59:07,746
You come into my house,

1074
00:59:08,033 --> 00:59:09,173
lie to my wife.

1075
00:59:09,773 --> 00:59:11,373
Get the fuck outta here.

1076
00:59:13,393 --> 00:59:14,993
We're on the first boat.

1077
00:59:16,253 --> 00:59:16,470
I don't want

1078
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,153
anything to do with you.

1079
00:59:18,433 --> 00:59:20,613
I remember your mother.

1080
00:59:25,893 --> 00:59:26,723
Yeah.

1081
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:31,673
I knew she was a drunk and a slut,

1082
00:59:33,493 --> 00:59:33,831
didn't know

1083
00:59:33,914 --> 00:59:35,393
she was a liar too.

1084
00:59:36,594 --> 00:59:37,430
Wanted you to think

1085
00:59:37,513 --> 00:59:40,153
your father was some kinda great man.

1086
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:42,930
She told you a fairytale,

1087
00:59:43,013 --> 00:59:43,843
kid.

1088
00:59:45,173 --> 00:59:46,073
Your father

1089
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:48,533
was no saint.

1090
00:59:50,713 --> 00:59:51,070
You didn't

1091
00:59:51,153 --> 00:59:52,333
miss out on much,

1092
00:59:53,914 --> 00:59:54,270
and that's

1093
00:59:54,353 --> 00:59:55,553
the fucking truth.

1094
01:00:01,393 --> 01:00:02,223
What?

1095
01:00:03,013 --> 01:00:03,330
You're gonna

1096
01:00:03,413 --> 01:00:04,733
try to kill me now?

1097
01:00:08,754 --> 01:00:09,887
I don't think so.

1098
01:00:34,453 --> 01:00:35,354
What is it?

1099
01:00:35,793 --> 01:00:36,623
He's here.

1100
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:42,053
Who? Just insulted my fucking mother.

1101
01:00:45,633 --> 01:00:46,766
Forget about him,

1102
01:00:47,814 --> 01:00:48,644
okay?

1103
01:00:49,194 --> 01:00:51,153
You're free, remember?

1104
01:00:51,974 --> 01:00:52,731
You're over it.

1105
01:00:52,814 --> 01:00:53,644
How could...

1106
01:00:54,633 --> 01:00:55,910
How can I get over everything he's

1107
01:00:55,993 --> 01:00:56,926
taken from me?

1108
01:00:58,814 --> 01:00:59,880
He took my whole

1109
01:01:00,633 --> 01:01:02,134
fucking life.

1110
01:01:03,773 --> 01:01:06,050
Just stop worrying about the love he didn'
t

1111
01:01:06,133 --> 01:01:06,963
get.

1112
01:01:08,241 --> 01:01:10,241
Think about the love you have.

1113
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:11,831
I love you.

1114
01:01:14,401 --> 01:01:15,401
I'm right here.

1115
01:01:20,601 --> 01:01:21,218
Are you going to get

1116
01:01:21,301 --> 01:01:23,178
the goddamn breakfast up there?

1117
01:01:23,261 --> 01:01:24,994
Are you all blind or what?

1118
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:28,558
Please don't

1119
01:01:28,641 --> 01:01:29,974
do something stupid.

1120
01:01:33,842 --> 01:01:34,672
Uh,

1121
01:01:35,481 --> 01:01:36,238
I'm- I'm fine.

1122
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:37,654
I gotta- I gotta go.

1123
01:01:38,881 --> 01:01:39,438
You're really

1124
01:01:39,521 --> 01:01:40,198
freaking me out.

1125
01:01:40,281 --> 01:01:42,281
I'm just gonna go see my lady.

1126
01:01:42,461 --> 01:01:43,158
What lady?

1127
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,861
The Indian lady.

1128
01:01:45,761 --> 01:01:46,591
That's it.

1129
01:01:45,842 --> 01:01:46,775
What did I do?

1130
01:01:47,342 --> 01:01:48,322
Go on then.

1131
01:01:48,842 --> 01:01:50,242
I'm going to be okay.

1132
01:01:52,022 --> 01:01:52,852
Shit.

1133
01:03:14,821 --> 01:03:15,651
Hey.

1134
01:03:16,882 --> 01:03:17,712
Yo.

1135
01:03:19,081 --> 01:03:20,814
What book are you reading?

1136
01:03:20,901 --> 01:03:21,731
What book?

1137
01:03:22,501 --> 01:03:23,901
The one in your hand.

1138
01:03:24,941 --> 01:03:26,418
Oh. I don't know.

1139
01:03:26,501 --> 01:03:27,834
Here, it's like a...

1140
01:03:28,081 --> 01:03:28,638
Morning.

1141
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:29,099
It's a book.

1142
01:03:29,182 --> 01:03:30,012
Whatever.

1143
01:03:30,962 --> 01:03:32,998
I'm going to let your father sleep.

1144
01:03:33,081 --> 01:03:33,911
He needs it.

1145
01:03:34,801 --> 01:03:35,881
Okay, let's go.

1146
01:03:38,301 --> 01:03:39,618
Lachlan, sweetheart,

1147
01:03:39,701 --> 01:03:40,702
breakfast.

1148
01:03:45,162 --> 01:03:46,228
Lachie, come on.

1149
01:03:47,261 --> 01:03:49,127
Okay, just meet us up there.

1150
01:04:38,522 --> 01:04:39,598
The treatment center,

1151
01:04:39,681 --> 01:04:40,079
uh, uh,

1152
01:04:40,162 --> 01:04:41,338
room is over there by the big blue bed.

1153
01:04:41,421 --> 01:04:42,251
Mom,

1154
01:04:43,081 --> 01:04:43,911
breathe.

1155
01:04:45,102 --> 01:04:46,978
Okay? We did that shit.

1156
01:04:47,061 --> 01:04:48,358
Yeah. We did that shit.

1157
01:04:48,441 --> 01:04:49,307
Yeah, we did.

1158
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:51,458
And you worked so hard,

1159
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:52,371
mom.

1160
01:04:53,481 --> 01:04:55,118
Good things happen to good people.

1161
01:04:55,201 --> 01:04:56,067
You're right.

1162
01:04:56,921 --> 01:04:57,751
I love you.

1163
01:04:58,781 --> 01:04:59,847
I love you, too.

1164
01:05:01,621 --> 01:05:02,378
Now go on.

1165
01:05:02,461 --> 01:05:04,461
Find your center or some shit.

1166
01:05:14,781 --> 01:05:15,611
Zion?

1167
01:05:16,481 --> 01:05:17,311
Yes, ma'am.

1168
01:05:17,522 --> 01:05:20,188
I will be sitting with you this morning.

1169
01:05:20,621 --> 01:05:21,681
Right this way.

1170
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:23,558
How are you?

1171
01:05:23,641 --> 01:05:24,758
I'm very well, thank you.

1172
01:05:24,841 --> 01:05:26,041
How are you doing?

1173
01:05:30,482 --> 01:05:31,922
Hey. Hey.

1174
01:05:32,982 --> 01:05:33,812
Hi.

1175
01:05:34,822 --> 01:05:36,239
I'll be right with you.

1176
01:05:36,322 --> 01:05:38,358
I- I- I really...

1177
01:05:38,441 --> 01:05:40,307
I- I- I need to talk to you.

1178
01:05:40,501 --> 01:05:41,762
I have a session.

1179
01:05:41,941 --> 01:05:42,941
This is urgent.

1180
01:05:43,262 --> 01:05:43,818
Okay, please?

1181
01:05:43,901 --> 01:05:45,218
I just need a few minutes of your time.

1182
01:05:45,301 --> 01:05:46,701
I can meet you after.

1183
01:05:47,781 --> 01:05:48,698
No. No. Uh,

1184
01:05:48,781 --> 01:05:50,058
just sit on this bench.

1185
01:05:50,141 --> 01:05:51,638
I'll have them bring you a clean blanket.

1186
01:05:51,721 --> 01:05:53,454
I need to talk to you now.

1187
01:05:54,621 --> 01:05:55,451
Please?

1188
01:05:55,961 --> 01:05:56,791
Look,

1189
01:05:57,762 --> 01:05:59,095
you'll be all right.

1190
01:05:59,401 --> 01:06:01,887
Okay? I'll come find you.

1191
01:06:03,641 --> 01:06:04,471
I promise.

1192
01:06:05,941 --> 01:06:07,407
Just give me one hour.

1193
01:06:07,741 --> 01:06:08,571
One hour.

1194
01:06:08,681 --> 01:06:09,511
Sorry.

1195
01:06:09,822 --> 01:06:11,088
I'll come find you.

1196
01:08:39,531 --> 01:08:46,531
Locke?

1197
01:09:35,392 --> 01:09:36,222
Locke!

1198
01:09:43,711 --> 01:09:44,541
Sir!

1199
01:09:45,251 --> 01:09:45,808
Wake up.

1200
01:09:45,891 --> 01:09:47,981
Hey. Wake up!

1201
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:49,381
Sir!

1202
01:09:49,891 --> 01:09:50,721
Sir!

1203
01:09:52,491 --> 01:09:52,848
Come on.

1204
01:09:52,931 --> 01:09:53,708
Come on.

1205
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,408
Co- come on.

1206
01:09:54,491 --> 01:09:55,321
Come on

1207
01:09:55,551 --> 01:09:56,381
now.

1208
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:58,011
Help!

1209
01:10:01,911 --> 01:10:03,688
Help! Help!

1210
01:10:03,771 --> 01:10:04,871
Somebody help!

1211
01:10:18,191 --> 01:10:19,869
How were the massages?

1212
01:10:19,952 --> 01:10:21,092
Oh, fantastic.

1213
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:24,584
We had to sneak one last in before we
leave.

1214
01:10:25,851 --> 01:10:27,848
Thank you for agreeing to a photo.

1215
01:10:27,931 --> 01:10:28,761
Oh. Hi.

1216
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:39,231
May I introduce you to my husband,

1217
01:10:39,671 --> 01:10:40,501
Hsu.

1218
01:10:41,071 --> 01:10:42,009
We love your show.

1219
01:10:42,092 --> 01:10:42,848
Aw. Well,

1220
01:10:42,931 --> 01:10:44,197
we love your hotel.

1221
01:10:44,372 --> 01:10:45,202
Good.

1222
01:11:09,771 --> 01:11:10,832
Oh, Belinda.

1223
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:16,091
How are you today?

1224
01:11:17,171 --> 01:11:18,231
Good, yeah.

1225
01:11:18,512 --> 01:11:20,501
Um, how are you?

1226
01:11:20,751 --> 01:11:22,371
I'm good, as usual.

1227
01:11:23,891 --> 01:11:24,757
Pornchai, um,

1228
01:11:27,012 --> 01:11:29,545
I've really loved getting to know you,

1229
01:11:31,372 --> 01:11:32,202
but,

1230
01:11:34,371 --> 01:11:36,149
some things have changed for me,

1231
01:11:36,232 --> 01:11:37,062
and

1232
01:11:38,531 --> 01:11:41,131
I'm gonna be leaving Thailand tomorrow.

1233
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:45,351
Uh, le- leaving

1234
01:11:46,512 --> 01:11:47,342
tomorrow?

1235
01:11:50,811 --> 01:11:51,811
What about, um,

1236
01:11:54,012 --> 01:11:55,931
starting a business?

1237
01:11:57,151 --> 01:11:58,851
You, me?

1238
01:11:59,131 --> 01:11:59,961
Maybe.

1239
01:12:00,811 --> 01:12:01,641
But,

1240
01:12:03,112 --> 01:12:05,378
circumstances have changed for me,

1241
01:12:05,591 --> 01:12:05,908
and I just

1242
01:12:05,991 --> 01:12:08,324
can't commit to anything right now.

1243
01:12:13,771 --> 01:12:15,131
I'm so sorry.

1244
01:12:19,191 --> 01:12:20,628
Uh, would you mind very much

1245
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:23,492
if we took a picture together?

1246
01:12:23,612 --> 01:12:24,671
Oh, of course.

1247
01:12:24,991 --> 01:12:25,988
Okay. Okay.

1248
01:12:26,071 --> 01:12:27,488
Okay? I'll go over here.

1249
01:12:27,571 --> 01:12:28,388
Okay. Yes.

1250
01:12:28,471 --> 01:12:29,604
Come, come, come.

1251
01:12:30,771 --> 01:12:32,471
Beautiful.

1252
01:12:33,911 --> 01:12:36,591
Wow. That's beautiful.

1253
01:12:38,531 --> 01:12:39,108
One more.

1254
01:12:39,191 --> 01:12:39,848
One more.

1255
01:12:39,931 --> 01:12:40,761
Yeah, yeah.

1256
01:12:39,971 --> 01:12:42,888
Okay. And maybe one of you will sit there.

1257
01:12:42,971 --> 01:12:43,568
Oh, yes.

1258
01:12:43,651 --> 01:12:45,571
Yes. Okay.

1259
01:12:47,452 --> 01:12:49,511
Wow. It's beautiful.

1260
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,448
Could Jim get the camera?

1261
01:12:51,531 --> 01:12:53,131
Yeah. Thank you so much.

1262
01:12:55,651 --> 01:12:56,481
Ah!

1263
01:12:57,612 --> 01:12:58,442
Surprise!

1264
01:12:57,691 --> 01:12:58,228
Oh, yeah.

1265
01:12:58,311 --> 01:12:58,968
That's good.

1266
01:12:59,051 --> 01:13:00,048
That's good for Jim.

1267
01:13:00,131 --> 01:13:02,804
Yeah. Yeah. The wife we have.

1268
01:13:14,071 --> 01:13:14,901
Rick?

1269
01:13:17,512 --> 01:13:18,578
Get out of here.

1270
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:25,313
Out of here.

1271
01:13:35,764 --> 01:13:36,703
Smile.

1272
01:13:40,823 --> 01:13:41,653
Oh, my God.

1273
01:13:43,203 --> 01:13:44,033
Oh, my God.

1274
01:13:44,823 --> 01:13:45,653
Fuck you.

1275
01:13:53,864 --> 01:13:54,694
Oh, God!

1276
01:13:58,723 --> 01:14:00,163
Jim. Are you okay?

1277
01:14:03,624 --> 01:14:05,280
Are you okay?

1278
01:14:05,363 --> 01:14:06,193
Go, go, go.

1279
01:14:09,183 --> 01:14:10,013
Go. Jim.

1280
01:14:09,203 --> 01:14:10,033
Jim. Why?

1281
01:14:10,723 --> 01:14:12,056
He killed my father.

1282
01:14:13,624 --> 01:14:14,864
He's your father.

1283
01:14:17,563 --> 01:14:18,780
He's your father.

1284
01:14:18,863 --> 01:14:19,743
He told me.

1285
01:14:20,143 --> 01:14:21,303
He's your father.

1286
01:14:37,543 --> 01:14:39,453
Go, go, go, go.

1287
01:15:31,303 --> 01:15:33,480
No. No, no, no, no, no,

1288
01:15:33,563 --> 01:15:34,444
no, no, no.

1289
01:15:34,784 --> 01:15:35,614
No, no.

1290
01:15:36,663 --> 01:15:37,596
Hey, hey, hey.

1291
01:15:37,763 --> 01:15:38,480
Hey, no.

1292
01:15:38,563 --> 01:15:39,480
You're okay.

1293
01:15:39,563 --> 01:15:39,781
All right?

1294
01:15:39,864 --> 01:15:41,240
You're going to be okay.

1295
01:15:41,323 --> 01:15:42,153
You hear me?

1296
01:15:42,284 --> 01:15:43,114
You hear me?

1297
01:15:44,724 --> 01:15:45,421
You can't die on me,

1298
01:15:45,504 --> 01:15:46,334
okay?

1299
01:15:47,243 --> 01:15:48,083
Chelsea.

1300
01:15:53,224 --> 01:15:54,054
No.

1301
01:15:54,924 --> 01:15:56,723
No. No!

1302
01:16:19,224 --> 01:16:20,054
Hey.

1303
01:16:21,183 --> 01:16:23,803
Hey! Help me, please.

1304
01:16:38,023 --> 01:16:43,863
I'm

1305
01:16:45,483 --> 01:16:46,313
sorry.

1306
01:16:46,403 --> 01:16:47,384
I'm so sorry.

1307
01:16:48,263 --> 01:16:49,440
We're going to be together forever,

1308
01:16:49,523 --> 01:16:52,109
okay? Just like you said.

1309
01:19:49,753 --> 01:19:51,286
I think I just saw God.

1310
01:20:05,293 --> 01:20:06,123
Oh, God.

1311
01:20:39,513 --> 01:20:45,353
Kids, look what I have.

1312
01:20:57,073 --> 01:21:04,073
Hey,

1313
01:21:08,913 --> 01:21:12,433
guys. Wait.

1314
01:21:16,954 --> 01:21:18,754
Things are about to change.

1315
01:21:23,573 --> 01:21:24,906
We'll get through it

1316
01:21:26,073 --> 01:21:26,914
as a family.

1317
01:21:28,073 --> 01:21:29,006
Because we're-

1318
01:21:30,013 --> 01:21:31,130
we're a strong family and-

1319
01:21:31,213 --> 01:21:32,043
and,

1320
01:21:34,033 --> 01:21:34,551
you know, nothing's

1321
01:21:34,634 --> 01:21:35,970
more important than family,

1322
01:21:36,053 --> 01:21:36,883
right?

1323
01:22:36,833 --> 01:22:43,833
Woo!

1324
01:25:20,573 --> 01:25:25,814
Nothing from nothing leaves nothing.

1325
01:25:27,073 --> 01:25:28,673
You gotta have something

1326
01:25:28,994 --> 01:25:30,594
if you wanna be with me.

1327
01:25:32,693 --> 01:25:35,474
Nothing from nothing leaves nothing.

1328
01:25:36,453 --> 01:25:38,053
You gotta have something

1329
01:25:38,353 --> 01:25:39,953
if you wanna be with me.

1330
01:25:47,893 --> 01:25:51,393
I'm not trying to be your hero

1331
01:25:52,573 --> 01:25:53,906
because that's zero,

1332
01:25:54,393 --> 01:25:56,073
it's too cold for me.

1333
01:25:58,333 --> 01:26:02,250
I'm not trying to be your highest 'cause

1334
01:26:02,333 --> 01:26:03,333
that, minus,

1335
01:26:03,753 --> 01:26:05,770
is too low to see.

1336
01:26:05,853 --> 01:26:06,683
Yeah.

1337
01:26:07,233 --> 01:26:08,153
Well, no.

1338
01:26:09,593 --> 01:26:10,423
Hey.

1339
